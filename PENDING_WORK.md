# Pending work — open obligations & attack paths

State after lap 2026-06-22. Build green (`lake build GoodsteinPA`, 1204 jobs). Phase 0 (encoding +
faithfulness bridge) axiom-clean. Phase 1 (Gödel II hook) landed. The headline stays a literal
`sorry` (anti-fraud). See `PHASE2-DECOMPOSITION.md` for the full girder ladder.

## Open obligations (toward a clean headline)

### O1 — `Reduction.goodstein_implies_consistency` (Route A girder) — `sorry`
`𝗣𝗔 ⊢ γ → 𝗣𝗔 ⊢ Con(𝗣𝗔)`. The deep ordinal-analysis content via Con(PA).
Attack paths:
1. **Gentzen `TI(ε₀) ⊢ Con(𝗣𝗔)` + `γ ⟹ TI(ε₀)`** — the classic route; needs `PA_∞`
   cut-elimination (same `Z_∞` machinery as Route B) plus the Con(PA) lower bound. Reuses
   Foundation's Gödel II downstream. (Buchholz `on-gentzens-first-consistency-proof`.)
2. **Drop Route A entirely for Route B** (recommended) — Towsner shows `𝗣𝗔 ⊬ γ` directly without
   Con(PA); then `goodstein_implies_consistency` becomes unnecessary (leave it as a documented,
   never-used alternative). The headline is discharged via O2's chain instead.
3. Partial: keep the lemma but prove the *easier* converse direction / a weaker reflection
   principle first as warmup, to exercise Foundation's provability API (`⊢`, `Con`, D1–D3).

### O2 — the Phase-2 girder (Route B, Towsner) — milestones M3…M7 in `PHASE2-DECOMPOSITION.md`
This is the real frontier. **Crux: M3 (`Z_∞` calculus) and M5 (cut elimination).**
Attack paths:
1. **Continue the `wip/Zinfty.lean` prototype** (E2 encoding — *compiles*). Next: (a) connect
   `AForm` to a faithful arithmetic formula with a real free-variable/substitution layer (replace
   the `ℕ → AForm` family with a single body + numeral substitution), so `rk` is genuinely
   finite; (b) state M3.3 bound-monotonicity lemmas; (c) state M4 embedding + M5 cut-elimination
   theorems as disclosed `sorry`s. Bank each as it typechecks; promote to `src/` when green.
2. **Develop M6 (Hardy domination) via Track 1.** `~/src/lean-formalizations` `Logic/FastGrowing`
   is building `h_α`, monotonicity, and Goodstein-length domination on mathlib's
   `ONote.fastGrowing`. Reuse those for M6.1–M6.3; only M6.4 (Thm 17.1, the cut-free lower bound)
   is new here. (Does NOT block M3–M5 — parallelizable.)
3. **Tackle cut-elimination (M5) on the prototype first**, before the embedding — it is the
   self-contained heart (Towsner §19: inversions 19.2–19.4, reductions 19.5–19.6, the `ω^α`
   step 19.7, iteration 19.9). If M5 proves tractable on the abstract `Deriv`, the whole route is
   credible; if not, that's the signal to reconsider the encoding (E1 vs E2).

### O3 — `PA_delta1Definable : 𝗣𝗔.Δ₁` (Foundation axiom) — only on Route A
Needed to *state* Gödel II for `𝗣𝗔`; Foundation axiomatizes it (TODO in
`Incompleteness/Examples.lean`). Route B avoids it. Attack paths:
1. **Avoid** — go Route B (O1 path 2); the axiom never enters the headline profile.
2. Discharge it: construct the Δ₁-definition of PA's axiom set (PA⁻ + induction scheme) in
   Foundation's `Theory.Δ₁` framework and prove `isDelta1`. Deep arithmetization; multi-lap.
3. Upstream: check whether a newer Foundation rev proves it (the TODO may get filled upstream);
   file an `ON-LINE-REQUEST.md` to check the latest Foundation `Incompleteness/Examples.lean`.

## Done this lap
- M1: `Encoding.goodsteinTerminates_re` proved (`Computability.lean`: `primrec_natLog`,
  `primrec_bump`, `primrec_goodsteinSeq`). Phase 0 axiom-clean.
- M2: `Reduction.lean` — Gödel II hook + meta-reduction (axiom-clean mod `PA_delta1Definable`).
- Phase 2: `PHASE2-DECOMPOSITION.md` (Towsner-grounded ladder) + `wip/Zinfty.lean` (E2 encoding
  prototype — compiles: ω-rule inductive, ordinal/cut-rank measures, bound-domination lemma,
  `Provable.mono`/`.weakening`, and the **proved predicate-level inference API** `Provable.orI`,
  `.exI`, `.allI` — the ω-rule with the supremum ordinal bound, machine-checked against the
  `Deriv` measures via `Classical.choice`).

## Gotcha noted (for the corpus)
For `Ordinal`, `add_le_add_right h c` elaborates to `c + a ≤ c + b` (adds on the *left*) — use
`add_le_add h le_rfl` to get `a + 1 ≤ b + 1` from `a ≤ b`. `gcongr` on `⨆`-bounds spawns a
`BddAbove (Set.range …)` side-goal (discharge with `Ordinal.bddAbove_range`).
