# PENDING WORK

## Lap 207 (2026-07-03, grind) — route-(c) steps (2)-root + (3) BOTH CLOSED sorry-free

- **`gated_of_sigma1`** (`wip/ReadoffValueGate.lean`, commit `f883dd8`): the root discharge
  `Hierarchy 𝚺 1 ψ → (∀ B, gvb ψ B ≤ P (max V B)) → Gated P V ψ` — kernel-clean, no sorryAx.
  Pieces: `sigma1_all_inv` (𝚺1 ∀-head inverts to ball ONLY), `gate_extract` (false ball instance
  pins `k < tvB t 0`, positivity makes the guard value instance-independent), `tvB_le_gvb_ball`;
  WF-recursion on complexity, coupled hypothesis self-threads via `gvb_substs_le` + max-algebra.
  Probe record: `wip/GateRootProbe.lean`.
- **`readoffVTC_core` + `readoff_value_Zef2TC`** (`wip/E1EmbeddingGrind.lean`, commit `5b26b4b`):
  the V-threaded value-budget read-off, **SORRY-FREE** — the `allω` trap is DISSOLVED (no
  branch-0 split at all: `Gated` gate always yields a false branch `k₀ ≤ P V`; `rel1_rel1`
  collapses the slot frame; `T3_descent'` absorbs all budget bumps incl. exI's `max V n`).
  Both `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`. Old `readoffTC_core` (trap sorry) superseded,
  left in place.
- **NEXT**: (i) wire the root certificate: the pipeline φ-instance is 𝚺1 ⟹ `Gated` via
  `gated_of_sigma1` with `P := fun B => gvb φ (max V B)` (copy the gvb/tvB layer into
  E1EmbeddingGrind at wiring time, or keep the certificate as a hypothesis); (ii) piece 2a
  structural wiring: root plumbing → `rankToZeroAuxTC` (EwLow entry) → `readoff_value_Zef2TC`
  (check the slot frame the pass output hands over vs the `Sslot` seed); (iii) 2b growth
  conversion (the `∃ o, o.NF ∧ …` splice target absorbs the looser `ewIter (Sslot …)` bound via
  the banked Hardy brackets). Judge package unchanged (do NOT self-ratify).


## Reflection — 2026-07-03 (lap 206, DEEP REFLECTION) — routes (a)/(b) for the read-off trap are DEAD on the real matrix; route (c) = the E–W-faithful VALUE-BUDGET read-off is MANDATED

**ROUTE VERDICT: CONTINUE** (destination + route sound; no unhandled fired trigger), **with a
piece-1 statement-shape retarget** — the lap-205 soft trigger ("if the bound cannot thread through
nested `allω` under the TC rules, the read-off statement shape must be rethought before assembling
the splice") HAS fired, and this reflection performs the mandated rethink.

**Independently re-verified this lap** (real `#print axioms`, bare `lake build` 🟢 1342, full
`lake env lean wip/E1EmbeddingGrind.lean` re-run): headline
`[propext, Classical.choice, goodstein_implies_consistency, Quot.sound]` sorryAx OFF, no drift;
Route-B headline = trust base + `wainer_bound_of_pa_proves_goodstein` + 12 native_decide; rungs
P/R/D `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]` in src; the ENTIRE wip bank kernel-clean (V3 ladder 10/10,
`embedding_Zef2TC_V3`, `passAuxTC`/`rankToZero_TC`/`sound0_TC`, `f0_le_ewIter`,
`three_le_rel1_rootSlot`, `ewIterTower_infl`) except exactly `readoffTC_core`/`readoff_delta0_Zef2TC`
(the ONE disclosed `allω`-trap sorry). Both headline statements re-read against the source claim —
`𝗣𝗔 ⊬ ↑goodsteinSentence`, `goodsteinSentence = “∀ m, ∃ N, !igoodsteinDef 0 m N”` — no transcription
drift. Fixation check: laps 202–205 each closed their mandated targets (no spin, no false summit —
whole-lemma targets closed repeatedly); the trap was probed EARLY as directed and honestly stalled.

### The central finding (source- and kernel-grounded): the handoff's two candidate trap-fixes both die

The lap-205 handoff proposed (a) the downward-closed guard `atomTrue (χ/[nm 0]) → atomTrue (∀⁰ χ)`
threaded over the spine, or (b) a φ-shape vacuity argument (no bounded-∀ reachable). Checked
against the ACTUAL pipeline matrix this lap:

- `igoodsteinDef : 𝚺₁.Semisentence 3` is `goodstein.blueprint.resultDef.rew …`
  (`InternalGoodstein.lean:46`) — the Foundation `PR.Construction` **machine-generated
  computation-history formula**: "∃ history code, decoded coherently". Its coherence clauses are
  bounded-∀s over the history ("∀ i < len, step i+1 follows from step i").
- **(a) is DEAD**: a history coherent at index 0 need not be coherent at index 3 — the mono-guard
  `0-instance-true → all-true` is FALSE for exactly these clauses. The guard hypothesis could be
  threaded through the read-off but could NEVER be discharged in piece 2a for the real φ.
- **(b) is DEAD**: those bounded-∀s sit inside the matrix on the instantiation spine; a rank-0
  cut-elim OUTPUT derivation may `allω`-decompose them (nothing in `Zef2TC` forbids it), so the
  trap is not vacuous for the pipeline.
- **Why E–W never see this trap** (`papers/eguchi-weiermann-2012-operator-controlled-id1.md` §4–5):
  their calculus carries the numeric content in the control THE WHOLE WAY — the embedding
  relativizes `f` by numeral VALUES (Lemma 33 `f[m+k]`, Lemma 34 "the numeral's value enters the
  f-relativization"), and rule side conditions (`N(ι₀) ≤ f(0)`, `N(max k^Π(A)) ≤ f(0)`, the
  `f[N(ι)]` ω-branch relativization) gate every branch index. `Zef2TC`'s `allω` carries NO such
  gate — **the trap is a calculus/invariant mismatch artifact, not a wall.** Their Thm-37 exit
  bound is `∃n ≤ s^α(m₀+⋯)` — an α-indexed iterate absorbing the relativization tower, NOT a
  constant `f(0)`; the repo's read-off should mirror that shape.

### Route (c) — MANDATED: the value-budget read-off (no calculus change, no re-grind of the bank)

Replace `readoffTC_core`'s invariant (constant bound `f 0`) by a value-budgeted one. The pieces are
all kernel-shaped:

1. **Subformula closure (free, already half-proven)**: from the singleton root `{∃⁰ φ}`, every
   Γ-member along the induction is a numeral-instance of a φ-subformula — weakening only SHRINKS
   contexts going up (`wk`/`weak` cases), `cut` is IMPOSSIBLE at `c = 0` (kernel-proven by `omega`
   in `zef2_rank0_uniform_spine_underivable`'s cut case), and every other rule inserts only
   subformula-instances. So junk ∀⁰-members never enter; χ is always a φ-subformula instance.
2. **The value gate**: φ (Σ₁/Δ₀, `Hierarchy 𝚺` structure) has ALL its ∀s ball-shaped
   `∀x (x <' t → …)`; a standard-FALSE instance has its least false branch `k₀ < val(t-instance)`
   (a false instance must satisfy the guard). With `P_φ B :=` max value of φ's (finitely many)
   subterms under numeral inputs `≤ B` — a FIXED monotone function of `B` — the trap descent is
   gated: `k₀ ≤ P_φ V` where `V` = the running instantiation budget.
3. **Bound algebra**: master bound = a norm-gated transfinite iterate (reuse the banked `ewIter`
   machinery / its threading lemmas) of the step `S x := max (f x) (P_φ x)`, seeded at
   `max (f 0) V`. Updates: `exI`-vacuous `V ↦ max V (f 0)`; `allω` false-branch descent
   `V ↦ max V k₀`, slot `f ↦ rel1 f k₀` (reads absorbed since `k₀ ≤` current seed). The 8 closed
   cases of `readoffTC_core` survive with V-threading edits.
4. **The exposed bound may legitimately loosen** from `ewIter f α 0` to the S-iterate: the ratified
   splice target `∃ o : ONote, o.NF ∧ EventuallyLE goodsteinLength (fastGrowing o)`
   (`WainerLadder.lean`) has TOTAL ordinal freedom in `o` — `P_φ` is elementary, `f` is the
   hardy-class tower slot, so the S-iterate is `fastGrowing`-dominated below ε₀ via the banked
   Hardy brackets (piece 2b's job anyway). `readoff_delta0_Zef2TC` is a wip draft — its statement
   is authoring-free; flag the (c) shape as judge input at promotion (package: read-off (c) +
   `Zef2TC` + (Ax2)).

**Probe order (trap-8 lesson — statement risk lives in the iterate algebra):** define the S-iterate
gadget + prove its TWO threading inequalities FIRST (ordinal-descent absorption at gated norms;
`rel1`-slot absorption), against the banked `ewIter` lemmas, BEFORE re-grinding the 9-case
induction. If the gadget's ordinal-monotonicity is kernel-refuted in a way `ewIter`'s norm-gating
can't fix, THAT is the escalation point for (c′).

**⭐ PROBE EXECUTED (lap 206, same lap): `wip/ReadoffValueGadgetProbe.lean` — the algebra CLOSES,
kernel-verified** (`T1_extract`/`T3_descent`/`T4_slot_read`/`S_max_mono_infl`, all
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` or less, sorry-free). Master bound
`BND V α := ewIter S α (S V)` (seed ONE `S` ahead) with `S x := max (f₀ x) (P_φ x)`:
- **T3 (decisive)**: `β < α` NF + gate `Nlog β ≤ S (S V)` + any budget bump `V' ≤ S V` ⟹
  `ewIter S β (S V') ≤ ewIter S α (S V)` — proven from `ewIter_monotone` + `ewIter_lower` alone.
  Covers the trap descent (`V' = max V k₀`, `k₀ ≤ P_φ V`), the vacuous-`exI` bump
  (`V' = max V (f₀ j)`), and same-budget `andI`/`orI`/branch-0 descents (`V' = V`).
- **T4**: slot along the descent stays `rel1 f₀ j`, `j ≤ V` (`rel1_rel1` collapses towers), so
  every calculus gate `Nlog β ≤ (slot) 0 = f₀ j ≤ S V ≤ S (S V)` is T3-shaped, and `exI` reads
  `n ≤ (slot) 0 ≤ S V ≤ BND V α` (T1).
- ⟹ **(c′) is OFF the table**; remaining work is (ii) `P_φ` + the ball value gate (Foundation
  `Hierarchy` structural work) and (iii) the V-threaded re-grind of `readoffTC_core` against
  `BND` (the `InstOf φ V` closure predicate + the 9 cases, 8 of which survive with V-edits).

**(c′) fallback — ESCALATION-ONLY, do NOT start it**: amend `Zef2TC.allω` with an E–W-style
branch/norm gate. Statement-cleanest but re-opens the ENTIRE banked V3 ladder + TC pass
(~10+ laps re-grind). Only on a kernel-refuted (c).

### KEEP / STOP / next target

- **KEEP**: the E-seam order (read-off first, then composition); wip-only discipline (no src
  self-ratification); probing decisive cases early; the banked-theorem freeze.
- **STOP**: pursuing routes (a)/(b) for the trap (kernel/source-dead above); treating the
  read-off's `f 0`-constant bound as required (the splice target doesn't need it).
- **Highest-value next target**: route (c), starting with the S-iterate gadget probe (the decisive
  algebra), then P_φ, then the V-threaded re-grind of `readoffTC_core`. Piece 2a's structural
  wiring (root-slot plumbing → `rankToZeroAuxTC`, banked lap 205) is bound-shape-independent and
  may proceed in parallel when a lap needs a second thread.
- **Ledger re-grade**: `wainer_bound_of_pa_proves_goodstein` 🟠 → **🟡** (the named "generational"
  reason — un-originated ordinal analysis of PA — has been dissolved by construction: P/R/D are
  src theorems, E is realized in wip; what remains is ONE lemma + composition + ratification =
  project-scale debt, chipped every lap). `goodstein_implies_consistency` stays 🟠 (frozen lane;
  discharged by re-point at endgame — its final disposition is an operator/judge call).

## lap 205 (FRESH-MIND REVIEW + E-seam piece 1) — bounded rank-0 `Zef2TC` read-off REALIZED (E–W Lemma 31), modulo ONE trap ✅

**Review**: direction SOUND (laps 202–204 CLOSED the lap-201 V3 mandate — V3 ladder 10/10, rung E
realized `embedding_Zef2TC_V3`, TC pass ported `passAuxTC`/`rankToZero_TC`/`sound0_TC`, all verified
kernel-clean this lap). Retargeted `DIRECTION.md` CURRENT DIRECTIVE (lap-205 block) + STATUS to the
two remaining E-seam wip pieces. See `HANDOFF-2026-07-03-lap205.md`.

**Advance (E-seam piece 1)**: `readoff_delta0_Zef2TC` + helper `readoffTC_core`
(`wip/E1EmbeddingGrind.lean`, file compiles, main `lake build` 🟢 1342 unaffected). From a rank-0
`Zef2TC` derivation of the SINGLETON `{∃⁰ φ}`, extract `∃ n ≤ ewIter f α 0, atomTrue (φ/[nm n])`.
Follows **E–W Witnessing Lemma 31** (the retirement-note-mandated route): extract the top `∃⁰ φ`
witness via `exI` at slot `f` (`n ≤ f 0`), verify the Δ₀ instance SEMANTICALLY via `sound0_TC`, NO
structural descent into `allω` matrix branches. Invariant = `∃⁰ φ ∈ Γ ∧ every other member
standard-false`, maintained by every rule at the CONSTANT bound `f 0`; `f 0 → ewIter f α 0` weakened
once at the root by `f0_le_ewIter` (fully clean `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`). **8 of 9 rule-cases
close** (axL/trueRel/trueNrel/verumR vacuous under the invariant; weak/wk/andI/orI/exI recurse at
slot `f`, using `sound0_TC` to kill empty contexts and the vacuous-`exI` re-witness; cut rank-0).

**THE ONE residual (disclosed `sorry` in `readoffTC_core`'s `allω` case)**: `∀⁰ χ` standard-false
(forced by the invariant) yet its `0`-instance `χ/[nm 0]` TRUE — the non-monotone-matrix trap. Then
`rel1 f 0 = f`'s sharp branch-0 recursion is unavailable and the semantic false-branch index
overflows the budget (kernel-refuted in general; trap-derivations EXIST in `Zef2TC` since (Ax2)
doesn't help when `∃⁰ φ` is the only true context member). This is EXACTLY the fragment
`readoffD_trapped_of_mono` (`OperatorZef2.lean`) closes under goodstein's downward-closed guard
`atomTrue (χ/[nm 0]) → atomTrue (∀⁰ χ)`.

**NEXT attack (close the residual, two candidate routes — the decisive statement-shape choice for the
judge)**:
- (a) **Downward-closed guard** — thread a hypothesis that every `allω`-principal `χ` on the spine
  satisfies `atomTrue (χ/[nm 0]) → atomTrue (∀⁰ χ)` (goodstein's bounded-`∀` guards `y < t → ψ`,
  `ψ` downward-closed, satisfy it). Under it the `χ/[nm 0]`-true branch contradicts `∀⁰ χ` false.
  Awkward to state (global over dynamic subformulas); may need a `Δ₀`-structural formulation.
- (b) **φ-shape argument** — show the embedding's `goodsteinBodyE = ∃⁰(matrix)` has no leading
  substituted bounded-`∀`, so the vacuous-`exI`→`allω` path that buries `∃⁰ φ` never arises ⇒ the
  trap is vacuous for the pipeline's derivations (cleaner if it holds; inspect `goodsteinBody`).
- Then **E-seam piece 2** — the composition, homed in `wip/E1EmbeddingGrind.lean` (E1EmbeddingGrind
  is NOT an importable module, so no separate `SpliceAssembly.lean`; append here). Two sub-parts:
  - **(2a) STRUCTURAL wiring → per-`m` bounded witness** (mostly plumbing, provable now modulo the
    piece-1 sorry): `embedding_Zef2TC_V3 h` gives per `m`: `K, H, Cl H α, D : Zef2TC α e H
    (rel1 (ewRootSlot e B) K) d {goodsteinBodyE/[nm m]}`. Root slot is **NOT EwF1** (`rel1` plateau
    below `K` breaks StrictMono) ⇒ feed **`rankToZeroAuxTC`** (EwLow entry) NOT `rankToZero_TC`:
    `hmono = rel1_monotone (ewRootSlot_f1 e B).monotone K`, `hinfl = rel1_infl … .infl K`,
    `hlow = rel1_low … K`, `h3 = three_le_rel1_rootSlot e B K` (**BANKED lap 205**). → `Zef2TCProv
    (collapseIter d α) e H (ewIterTower (rel1 (ewRootSlot e B) K) d α) 0 {…}`; unpack to `Zef2TC α'
    … 0 {…}` (`α' ≤ collapseIter d α`). Rewrite `goodsteinBodyE/[nm m] = ∃⁰ φ_m` (via
    `Rewriting.app_exs` + `goodsteinBody = ∃⁰ inner`; goodsteinBody `= ∃ N, !igoodsteinDef 0 m N`).
    Apply `readoff_delta0_Zef2TC (ewIterTower_infl hinfl α d) D'` (**`ewIterTower_infl` BANKED lap
    205**) → `∃ N ≤ ewIter (ewIterTower … d α) α' 0, atomTrue (φ_m/[nm N])`.
  - **(2b) GROWTH conversion → `wainer_splice_Zef2`** (the substantial multi-lap part): convert the
    concrete `ewIter (ewIterTower …) α' 0` bound + `atomTrue (φ_m/[nm N])` ("goodstein(m) hits 0 by
    step N") into `∃ o NF, EventuallyLE goodsteinLength (fastGrowing o)` via the banked Hardy
    Lemma-19 brackets (`src/GoodsteinPA/Hardy.lean`: `hardy_omega_pow_lt_fastGrowing`,
    `hardy_add_le_comp`). This is the E–W growth-domination glue; scope it against `WainerRoute`'s
    `EventuallyLE`/`goodsteinLength`. rung-E statement promotion (splice sorry-free) is
    post-judge-ratification.
- rung-E statement + `Zef2TC` amendment + read-off statement shape (guard vs φ-shape) → next judge
  pass. Do NOT self-ratify into src.

---

## lap 201b (E-1 block 6) — V3 predicate + THE `all` CASE DISCHARGED ✅

`budgetedEmbedsV3_all` SORRY-FREE, `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`
(`wip/E1EmbeddingGrind.lean`, build 🟢 1342). The decisive route-critical sub-crux of rung E is
CLOSED — the block-8 `all` obstruction is a predicate-shape artifact. V3 = move node ordinal `α`
+ budgets OUTSIDE `∀ env`; ordinal uniformizes free (`β n := α`), budget index paid by
`envSup_cons_le` + `rel1_rel1`. See ledger block 11 + `HANDOFF-2026-07-03-lap201.md`.

**NEXT (block 7)**: re-close mechanical cases against `BudgetedEmbedsV3` (structural α — simpler
than block 8); then `exs` (domination field discharged by `e > ω²·c`, `B ≥ norm(ω²·c)` ⇒
`Gexp^[c] = H_{ω²·c} ≤ ewRootSlot e B` via `hardy_le_of_lt`); then `axm` (W1/W2). Reassemble over
V3 → rung-E statement + Ax2 probe → next judge pass. Do NOT self-ratify into src.

---

## lap 201 (FRESH-MIND REVIEW) — direction RETARGETED to Lane E; rung E is the last hard rung

**Re-verified this lap** (real `#print axioms`, bare `lake build` 🟢 1342): headline
`[propext, Classical.choice, goodstein_implies_consistency, Quot.sound]`, sorryAx OFF, no drift.
Rungs **P** (`cutElimPass_Zef2`), **R** (`rankToZero_Zef2`), **D** (`readoff_delta0_Zef2`) all
`[propext, choice, Quot.sound]` — REAL. Splice `wainer_splice_Zef2` (`WainerLadder.lean:41`)
carries the sole live `sorryAx`, at the rung-E consumption point.

**Direction is SOUND** — laps 198→200 correctly walked N→D→E (crux-first: the top-rank cut
landed lap 198, the escalated lap-192 trilemma dissolved by SERIES-2 ruling (1) `ewN→Nlog`). Only
the stale lap-192 `DIRECTION.md` directive (still mandating the now-done Lane D + the now-resolved
top-rank escalation) needed retargeting → set the lap-201 CURRENT DIRECTIVE block.

**MANDATED next attack — Lane E, rung E, E-1 block 6 = the V3 predicate** (`wip/E1EmbeddingGrind.lean`):
1. Restate `BudgetedEmbedsTC` with the witness budget bounded by a STRUCTURAL function of the
   assignment — slot `rel1 (ewRootSlot e B) (Gexp^[c] (envSup env N))`-shaped, or a side condition
   `K ≤ hardy e (max B (envSup env N))`. Growth kit banked lap 200: `Gexp = H_{ω²}` closed form,
   `term_val_le_Gexp_iter` (term value ≤ `Gexp^[c](envSup env N)`), `Gexp_iter_eq_hardy`
   (`Gexp^[c] = H_{ω²·c}`, absorbable into the control ordinal `e`), `envSup` + `envSup_cons_le`.
2. Re-close the 8 landed cases (joins unchanged — mechanical) + re-prove `exs` against
   `stdClosedVal_asg_le_Gexp_iter`.
3. **`all`** — THE DECISIVE CASE — uniformize the per-branch `(K_n, α_n)` over the ω-rule via
   `envSup_cons_le` (branch sup ≤ `max n` root sup) + `rel1_rel1`. If this cannot close, the
   SomeK/W3 statement shape itself must be rethought → probe `all` EARLY, before polishing the rest.
4. **`axm`** — W1/W2 finite 𝗣𝗔⁻ axioms via `trueRel` bounded truth (à la `provable_true`);
   induction schema = cut-tower.

When V3 closes the ladder (`all` + `axm` sorry-free), the accumulated rung-E statement + the E-0
Ax2-need probe go to the **next judge pass** for ratification. **Do NOT self-ratify the rung-E
statement into `src`** — promotion is post-ratification (SERIES-3 order). Lane W (`wainer_splice_Zef2`)
shrinks to the E-seam as rungs land.

**FORBIDDEN** (lap-201 block + SERIES-3 order): hygiene/leaf-retreat while rung E is open;
Route-A surfaces; self-ratifying the rung-E statement (or `Zef2T`/(Ax2)) into `src`; re-grinding a
landed rung; `rel1`/norm/output `src` changes except a ratified SERIES-3 pivot; idle/padding laps.

---

## lap 198 (SERIES-3, Lane N COMPLETE) — pass LANDED; next = D-3

- Rungs P + R are REAL (`cutElimPass_Zef2`, `rankToZero_Zef2` = standard triple); norm swap
  `ewN → Nlog` executed in src; see `HANDOFF-2026-07-03-lap198.md` + Series-3 ledger blocks 1-3.
- NEXT: **D-3** — R-4′ restatement of `readoff_delta0_Zef2` (bound `∃ n ≤ ewIter f α 0`),
  retire `readoffD_trapped` (`OperatorZef2.lean:~1369`, the sole remaining sorry there),
  over the Nlog calculus. Then E-0 (rung-E DRAFT + Ax2-need probe, wip), E-1, W-1.

# Pending work — open obligations & attack paths

## LAP 197 (SERIES-2 D-1 CLOSED) — `Nlog_finite_fiber` PROVEN; probe sorry-free; NF restriction shown necessary

**D-1 is now FULLY dispositive: BOTH ruling properties are theorems.**
`wip/AbsorbingNormProbe.lean` is sorry-free, all kernel-clean `[propext, Classical.choice,
Quot.sound]`:
- `Nlog_finite_fiber : ∀ K, {α | NF α ∧ Nlog α ≤ K}.Finite` — property (i) PROVEN. Method:
  induction on `K` + inner **well-founded induction on the `NFBelow` bound ordinal** (the tail
  of `oadd e n a` lives in the `NFBelow (repr e)` fiber, `repr e < b`; the exponent lives in the
  outer-IH finite `Nlog ≤ K` fiber; coefficient `< 2^(K+2)`). No Finset `nlogBallBelow` needed.
- `Nlog_fiber_infinite_without_NF` — the lap-196 UNRESTRICTED statement was FALSE: non-NF flat
  chains `oadd 0 1 (oadd 0 1 …)` all have `Nlog = 1`. The correct ruling candidate is finite
  fibers **on NF notations** (the only population the calculus uses; `ewBall` clients are NF).
- Property (ii) was already proven lap 196 (`Nlog_add_le_max_succ`).

**Stage C-1 DONE (same lap): Option-B splice feasibility = YES, structurally free.**
`wip/OptionBSpliceProbe.lean`: the Option-B exit bound is the `(d+1)`-tower BY DEFINITION
(`optionB_tower_step`, `rfl`); generic composition `optionB_splice_exit` through `rankToZeroAux`
(inherits only rung R's disclosed sorryAx). R-4′ draft text in the probe docstring. With
`readoffD_trapped_of_mono`, (Ax2) is needed by NEITHER read-off NOR splice on the headline
path. Ledger Stage C-1 block written. Producer-side caveat recorded (Series-3).

**Stage C-2 DONE (same lap): mono guard REFUTED — Option B is LOAD-BEARING.**
`wip/GuardMonoProbe.lean` (kernel-clean): `guardShape_not_mono` — the bounded-∀
guarded-implication step-clause shape (`x < 2 → x = 0` as the minimal representative of the
`igoodsteinDef` run-coding clauses) has TRUE 0-instance and FALSE ω-universal, so
`readoffD_trapped_of_mono` does NOT cover the concrete goodstein translation. Stage C combined
verdict for ruling (2): recommend the R-4′ restatement (bound `f 0 → ewIter f α 0`; splice cost
one definitional tower level per C-1); (Ax2) stays solely a rung-E question. Ledger updated.

**Stage B DONE (same lap): (Ax2)-adequacy ANSWERED.** `wip/Ax2AdequacyProbe.lean`
(kernel-clean): `Zef2T` clone; (i) STRICT extension at rank 0 (`{0=0}` Zef2T-derivable,
Zef-underivable via the all-literal pair invariant) — `toZef` read-off route breaks;
(ii) pins-1–2 new leaf case mechanical (`reduction_trueLit_case`, same `ewN_add_le_comp`
arithmetic); (iii) falsity-invariant read-offs extend with vacuous cases; `allω` trap
UNCHANGED per-derivation — (Ax2)'s value is embedding-side derivation existence (Lemma 31).
Recommendation shape: (Ax2) iff rung E needs it; lane D takes R-4′ regardless. Ledger updated.

**NEXT (ladder, last remaining stage):**
1. **Stage D-2 — shift-relativization `rel1'` cost probe** (`rel1' f n = fun m => f (n+m)`;
   kernel-check it preserves `hg_base`/`2m+1` floor/Monotone; measure blast radius — which
   Series-1-ratified statements mention `rel1`, does `allω` bind `rel1` or take slot as data).
   After D-2: SERIES END → STOP for the judge (per the order).

## LAP 196 (SERIES-2 Stage A + D-1) — rung-W homed at concrete translation; absorbing-norm EXISTS (top-rank-cut ruling input)

**Order in force:** `REBUILD-Z-SERIES-2-ORDER-2026-07-03.md` (statement/probe series, 2–4 laps;
ladder P1→P5; STOP for judge at series end). Ledger: `REBUILD-Z-SERIES-2-LEDGER.md`.

**Stage A (P1, mechanical debt) — CLOSED.** Created `src/GoodsteinPA/WainerLadder.lean`; moved +
restated `wainer_splice_Zef2` VERBATIM at the R-5 non-parametric shape (= the statement of the
`wainer_bound_of_pa_proves_goodstein` axiom); deleted the VOIDed parametric `wainer_splice_Zef2`
and `embedding_Zef2` placeholders from `OperatorZef2.lean`; blueprint tex re-bound; stale
`wip/Lap13ReadoffDeltaProbe.lean` removed. Build 🟢 1342, headline undrifted, `blueprint_audit` ✓.

**Stage D-1 (P2, top-rank-cut trilemma probe) — POSITIVE RESULT.**
`wip/AbsorbingNormProbe.lean` (compiles standalone; `src` untouched). **The lap-192 conjecture
"finite fibers force additivity (T-Z7(i))" is REFUTED**: the max-over-terms + log-coefficient
norm `Nlog (oadd e n a) = max (Nlog e + clog n) (Nlog a)`, `clog n = ⌊log₂(n+1)⌋`, is
finite-fibered AND absorbing (`Nlog(α+γ) ≤ max(Nlog α)(Nlog γ)+1`). Kernel-checked: absorption on
merge/concat/drop adversaries (`decide`); `ewN` VIOLATES absorption for every fixed constant
(`ω·k+ω·k`); `Nlog` grows on the tower spine (`Nlog(spine k)=k+1`, avoids the max-coeff norm's
infinite-fiber failure mode); `absorbing_closes_gate` reduces the node gate to the weak slack
`max(g0)(f0)+c ≤ g(f0)`. So the top-rank-cut TRILEMMA's prime amendment candidate is kernel-evidenced
to EXIST — the judge can dissolve the gate by `ewN → Nlog` without touching `rel1` or the output ordinal.

**P3 DEEPENING DONE this lap: `Nlog_add_le_max_succ` PROVEN** (kernel-clean
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`). The general absorbing theorem — `∀ NF α γ,
Nlog(α+γ) ≤ max(Nlog α)(Nlog γ)+1` — is a THEOREM now, not just evidenced: induct on α,
`lt_trichotomy` on the two leading exponents, each case pins the syntactic form of `α+γ` via
`repr_inj` + ordinal absorption (the `eq`/merge case's `a+γ=γ` absorption collapses the two-`+1`
compounding). So absorbing property (ii) is DISPOSITIVE.

**NEXT ATTACK (remaining D-1 sorry):** `Nlog_finite_fiber` (property (i) in full) — build
`nlogBallBelow b K` (ONotes with `Nlog ≤ K`, exponents `< b`, à la `NFBelow`) by well-founded
recursion; or prove `ewN α ≤ F(Nlog α)` by the exponent-set induction. Either mechanizes the
documented strategy (`Nlog_spine` growth is the kernel witness it avoids the infinite-fiber
failure mode). Landing this makes BOTH ruling properties fully proven.

**Other SERIES-2 lanes still open (P2, independent):** Stage B (rung-E Ax2-adequacy probe,
`wip/Ax2AdequacyProbe.lean` — `Zef2T` clone + Lemma-31 read-off miniature); Stage C (lane-D
Option-B splice feasibility against the `ewIter f α 0` bound); Stage D-2 (shift-relativization
`rel1'` cost). A wall on one licenses moving to another.

## LAP 195 (grind, lane D) — `readoffD_trapped` NARROWED in-kernel to the NON-MONOTONE-MATRIX case (branch-0 sharp bound via `rel1 f 0 = f`)

**Also banked this lap (sorry-free, axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`):**
`readoffD_trapped_of_mono` — the residue is DISCHARGED when the local monotone-instance condition
`atomTrue (χ/[nm 0]) → atomTrue (∀⁰ χ)` holds (then `h0` contradicts `hfalse`). Proves the branch-0
mechanism fully closes the well-behaved (downward-closed-guard) fragment without E–W's (Ax2) — a
ready building block for a monotone-guarded specialization of `readoff_delta0_Zef2`.


Landed a real narrowing of the sole rung-D residue (build 🟢 1328, headline undrifted, sorryAx OFF;
commit on `plan`). **The whole monotone/branch-0-false portion of the trap is now DISCHARGED
in-kernel**, isolating the obstruction to a strictly smaller case.

### The advance
- **Structural key: `rel1 f 0 = f`.**  `rel1 f n = fun x => f (max n x)`, and `max 0 x = x`, so
  branch `0` of the `allω` node runs at the *un-relativized* slot `f`.  In particular
  `rel1 f 0 0 = f 0` — the sharp bound with NO relativization growth.
- **`readoffD_aux`'s `allω`/trapped case now splits on `χ/[nm 0]`:**
  - `χ/[nm 0]` FALSE ⇒ recurse into branch 0 (slot `rel1 f 0 = f`), IH yields `∃ m ≤ rel1 f 0 0 = f 0`.
    **Closed, no residue.**
  - `χ/[nm 0]` TRUE ⇒ residue `readoffD_trapped`, which now carries the added hypothesis
    `h0 : atomTrue (χ/[nm 0])`.
- **Consequence:** the residue survives ONLY when the Δ₀ matrix `χ` is *non-monotone* in its numeral
  instances — `χ/[nm 0]` true while `∀⁰ χ` is false (so every FALSE branch sits at index `≥ 1`,
  where the slot has grown to `rel1 f k₀ 0 = f k₀ ≥ f 0`).  This is precisely the case E–W close via
  the (Ax2) true-literal rule.

### Why this matters / NEXT
- It **confirms and sharpens** the lap-194c diagnosis: (Ax2)'s job is exactly to short-circuit the
  non-monotone-matrix branch (close a true Δ₀ leaf without deep-witnessing the trapped `∃⁰ φ`).  The
  monotone-guard fragment (any matrix where `∀⁰ χ` false forces `χ/[nm 0]` false — e.g. a bounded-`∀`
  guard `y < t → ψ` with `ψ` downward-closed) is now fully handled WITHOUT (Ax2).
- **Option 2 (pure-proof vacuity) is now scoped to a decidable question:** can `Zef2`-without-(Ax2)
  derive a rank-0 sequent whose only true member is a `∃⁰ φ` witnessed solely at index `≥ 1` inside a
  false-`∀⁰ χ` branch with `χ/[nm 0]` TRUE?  This is the concrete target for a wip kernel probe (build
  a candidate trap term, or prove no `axL`-closable leaf can arise) — a much tighter goal than the
  original monolith.  Start there next lap.
- The (Ax2) architect gate (shared with rung E) is UNCHANGED; this lap did not touch the calculus.

### DECISIVE grounding (read Towsner §Thm 17.1 + E–W Lemma 31 this lap) — the residue is NOT a slick structural fix
Cross-checked the two source read-offs:
- **Towsner Thm 17.1** (the cut-free lower bound) proves its invariant with an explicit **growth
  coupling**: every `φ ∈ Γ` is (i) `∀x∃y g_y(x)=0`, (ii) `∃y g_y(n)=0` for `n ≤ k` **with
  `𝒢(n) > h_α(k)`**, or (iii) `g_t(n)=0`, `t < 𝒢(n)`.  The `∃I`/`∀I` cases turn on the numeric bound
  `k` and the ordinal `α` being TOO SMALL (`witness ≤ h_α(k) < 𝒢(n)`).  The coupling between the
  witness budget and the fast-growing `h_α` is CARRIED IN THE INVARIANT.
- **`readoffD_aux`'s invariant carries NO such coupling** — only "`= ∃⁰φ` or `¬atomTrue`".  That is
  exactly why the non-monotone `allω` residue (slot grows to `rel1 f k₀ 0 = f k₀`) cannot be closed:
  nothing ties the grown budget back to `f 0`.
- **E–W's Lemma 31** dodges it only via **(Ax2)** (verify a true Δ₀ matrix leaf SEMANTICALLY, never
  descend it) — the rule `Zef2` lacks.

**Conclusion (escalation-grade) — CORRECTED after reading the `ewIter`/`ewN` gate algebra
(`EwIter.lean`) and the splice consumer (`wainer_splice_Zef2`):** the ratified conclusion `n ≤ f 0`
is **ordinal-INDEPENDENT**, but the structural `allω` descent can only ever achieve an
**ordinal-DEPENDENT** bound: branch `k₀`'s witness is bounded by its slot-at-0 `rel1 f k₀ 0 = f k₀`
(and deeper, `f(max path index)`), which `ewIter_lower`-monotonicity aggregates to `≤ ewIter f α 0` —
**strictly weaker than `f 0`** for `α ≠ 0` / monotone growing `f`.  No structural invariant
(growth-coupled or not) recovers `f 0`; that bound genuinely relies on E–W's **(Ax2)** semantic
matrix-verification shortcut (which stops the descent).  *(So the earlier "Route B growth-coupled
invariant recovers `f 0`" idea is REFUTED — an ordinal drop `β k₀ < α` cannot lower the witness's
own slot-at-0.)*  Hence the residue closes by exactly two routes, **both judged/architect-owned**:
- **(A) add (Ax2) to `Zef2`** — architect-gated, shared with rung E's Ax2-adequacy.  **Sanctioned
  next step = a WIP-ONLY probe** (handoff-194c NEXT option 1): in `wip/`, add the (Ax2) true-literal
  rule to a copy of `Zef2` and re-prove the read-off à la E–W Lemma 31 (extract top-`∃⁰φ` via `exI` at
  slot `f`, verify `φ/[nm n]` via `sound0`, NO `allω` descent).  Demonstrating it discharges the
  read-off is decisive escalation input.  **Do NOT add (Ax2) to `src`.**
- **(B) amend the statement** to the achievable `n ≤ ewIter f α 0` (which the splice consumes an
  `ewIter … α 0` quantity anyway — check whether the weaker bound suffices for `wainer_splice_Zef2`).
  This changes the R-4-ratified `readoff_delta0_Zef2` conclusion ⇒ a judged amendment, NOT
  self-ratifiable.

**Disposition:** lane D's generic residue is **GATED** (the DIRECTION lap-192 premise "sole open
PROOF-only lane" is refuted for the residue by this lap's algebra check).  The maximal structural
fragment IS banked sorry-free (`readoffD_trapped_of_mono` + the branch-0 narrowing).

### SHARPENED (Ax2) analysis — (Ax2) is NOT a mechanical add-on to the falsity invariant
The handoff-194c NEXT ("add (Ax2), then prove the read-off à la Lemma 31") is NOT a mechanical
follow-through.  Reasoning directly about the `readoffD_aux` induction:
- Adding a leaf rule `axT` (a true closed literal closes the sequent) adds a NEW induction case, but
  that case is **VACUOUS under the falsity hypothesis** (a true literal member contradicts "every
  member is `∃⁰φ` or `¬atomTrue`"), exactly like `axL`.  So the problematic **`allω` trapped case is
  entirely UNCHANGED** — (Ax2) does not touch it.
- Worse, (Ax2) **ENLARGES** the derivation set, so `readoffD_trapped`'s premise `hbranch` (all
  branches derivable) is EASIER to satisfy ⇒ MORE potential traps.  So bolting (Ax2) onto the naive
  falsity-invariant is counterproductive.
- **Therefore E–W's Lemma 31 must exploit (Ax2) via a fundamentally DIFFERENT read-off** — a
  top-level-`∃` witness extraction (collect each `⋁`/`exI` witness, all `≤ f 0`) with the Δ₀ matrices
  verified SEMANTICALLY through (Ax2)+soundness, NEVER the structural `allω` descent that
  `readoffD_aux` performs.  The current `readoffD_aux` scaffold is the WRONG frame for the (Ax2)
  route; a from-scratch Lemma-31 read-off is required, and reproducing that mechanism faithfully is
  the DEEP content (it is where E–W's growth coupling / operator-relativization bookkeeping lives).

**Net:** lane D is **GATED ((Ax2) or statement amendment, judge/architect-owned) AND heroic** (the
(Ax2) route needs the deep E–W Lemma 31 mechanism, not a mechanical add-on).  Narrowed maximally this
lap.  The productive future work is either the judge's (Ax2)/restatement ruling, or a from-scratch
E–W-Lemma-31 read-off in `wip/` (heroic; a copy of `Zef2 + axT`, top-`∃` extraction, NO `allω`
descent) — the latter narrows the deep content but cannot reach `src` until the ruling lands.

## LAP 194c (grind, lane D) — `readoffD_trapped` ROOT-CAUSED via the E–W Lemma 31 PROOF: it needs the (Ax2) amendment (architect-gated, SHARED with rung E)

Read the actual E–W Lemma 31 proof from the PDF (`papers/eguchi-weiermann-2012-…`, extracted). It
resolves the residue's true nature and connects it to rung E:

- **E–W code `∃` as `⋁`-type (operator UNCHANGED under `(⋁)`, witness `N(t) ≤ f(0)`) and `∀` as
  `⋀`-type (operator RELATIVIZED `f → f[N(ι)]` under `(⋀)`)** — exactly our `exI` (keeps `f`) vs
  `allω` (`rel1 f ·`, relativizes). E–W ALSO have **(Ax2): a true closed literal `Γ ∩ TRUE₀ ≠ ∅`
  closes the sequent** — which this `Zef2` LACKS (only `axL` = complementary PAIR).
- **Lemma 31's induction extracts the l TOP-LEVEL `∃`-witnesses via `(⋁)` at operator `f` (all
  `≤ f(0)`) and verifies the Δ₀ matrix instances SEMANTICALLY** (the proof: "`B(t)` must be true in
  ℕ" via soundness — it NEVER structurally re-derives the matrix). So `(⋀)`/`allω` relativization is
  confined to *deriving* Δ₀ instances and never touches the top-`∃` witness budget.
- **Our `readoffD_trapped` is the artifact of `readoffD_aux` STRUCTURALLY descending the matrix via
  `allω`** (relativizing the slot) — precisely what E–W's witnessing avoids.

### Root cause + fix
The trap traces to `Zef2` missing E–W's **(Ax2)** true-literal rule. Without it, a false `∀⁰χ`
branch cannot close on a true Δ₀ literal, so it is forced to consume the trapped `∃⁰ φ` deep (bound
`f n > f 0`). **Fix = mirror E–W:** (a) add (Ax2) to `Zef2`; (b) prove the read-off by extracting the
top-`∃⁰ φ` witness via `exI` at slot `f` and verifying `φ/[nm n]` truth via `sound0` (semantic),
WITHOUT recursing into `allω` matrix branches.

### STRATEGIC CONSEQUENCE (escalation-grade)
Adding (Ax2) is the **architect-gated Ax2-adequacy** already flagged for rung E (`Zekd` has
`trueRel`/`trueNrel`, `Zef2` has none, E–W Def 23 has (Ax2), per `spike-z1-pass…` / the laps-8–9
ruling). **So the rung-D read-off residue and rung E's gate are ONE calculus-faithfulness decision.**
If the architect ratifies adding (Ax2) to `Zef2`, BOTH become tractable together. This is NOT a
self-ratifiable change (a judged/architect calculus amendment, like the `rel1` redesign).

### Remaining pure-proof alternative (in-scope, if (Ax2) is not ratified)
Show trap-derivations do NOT EXIST in `Zef2`-without-(Ax2): with fewer leaves (no true-literal
closure), the false `∀⁰χ` branch may be underivable, making the residue vacuous. This needs a
normalization/occurrence meta-argument on the singleton derivation (not the branch-local induction,
which is refuted) — substantial but not gated.

## LAP 194b (grind, lane D) — `readoffD_trapped` DECISIVELY characterized: branch-local data is INSUFFICIENT; the fix is root-side witness accumulation (Option A)

Pushed the sole rung-D residue `readoffD_trapped` to a decisive characterization (docstring in
`OperatorZef2.lean` sharpened; build 🟢, headline undrifted):

- **The lemma as stated is UNDER-hypothesized — no branch-local structural induction can close it.**
  In this calculus the ONLY source of an `f 0`-bounded witness is an `exI` on `∃⁰ φ` fired at the
  UNRELATIVIZED slot `f` (its `hbound : n ≤ f 0`). Inside the trapped `allω` subtree everything runs
  at `rel1 f ·` or deeper, so NO slot-`f` `exI` occurs there; the `f 0` witness, if any, lives on the
  ROOT-side of the derivation, out of `hbranch`'s scope. Branch-local induction is REFUTED.
- **Root cause = `∃⁰ φ` retained in an `exI`'s side-context** (Finset `Seq` ⇒ no multiplicative
  contraction; the trap is `insert (∃⁰φ) Γ` with `∃⁰φ ∈ Γ`, i.e. the `exI` fires "in place" keeping
  `∃⁰φ`). If `∃⁰φ` is dropped on its `exI`, it is never in a later `allω`'s `Γ₀` and `readoffD_aux`
  closes with NO residue — exactly why the atomic `readoff_sigma1_Zef` needs no such case (atomic
  instances have no `∀⁰` subformula ⇒ `allω` never fires below the `exI`).
- **Δ₀ IS load-bearing after all (corrects lap-194 finding #1's over-reach):** the goodstein matrix
  arithmetizes to Δ₀ with a bounded-`∀` "every step valid" clause, which is exactly the `∀⁰χ` that
  `allω`-descends and enables the trap. The falsity invariant doesn't *consume* `hφbdd` syntactically,
  but the trap it leaves open is precisely the bounded-`∀` node — so the Δ₀ structure is where the
  Towsner §5.4 witnessing must bite.

### NEXT — path selection (accumulation REFUTED; two paths remain)
- **Accumulation (naive Option A) — REFUTED this lap.** The idea was to carry the root-nearest
  slot-`f` `exI` witness (`n ≤ f 0`) down and return it in the trapped branch. It fails: an `exI`'s
  chosen witness `n ≤ f 0` need NOT make `φ/[nm n]` TRUE (the derivation can pick a false witness and
  continue via other members / deeper structure), so there is no *true* bounded witness to
  accumulate. Truth only emerges at `axL` leaves / via `sound0`, by which point the `f 0` bound is
  gone. So no invariant that threads a true `≤ f 0` witness is inductive.
- **Option A′ (caller shape / contraction-free exit) — still viable, needs investigation.** Show the
  reduction-exit derivation (`rankToZero` output) never fires an in-place `exI` on `∃⁰ φ` (never
  retains `∃⁰ φ` in a side-context), so `∃⁰ φ` is dropped on its `exI`, no `allω` below traps it, and
  `readoffD_aux` closes with no residue. Requires reading the embedding/reduction construction to
  confirm the exit shape — a separate investigation, but keeps the read-off statement pure.
- **Option B (growth-coupled) — the semantic fallback, likely the real content.** The bounded witness
  must exist because a derivation at slot `f` with NO true witness `≤ f 0` cannot exist at all — a
  soundness+completeness/growth argument (Towsner §5.4 / Thm 17.1 clause (ii), `𝒢(n) > h_α(k)`), not
  a structural read-off. Couples the read-off to the banked Part-2 fast-growing lower bound.
- If neither A′ nor B threads, the read-off statement may need a contraction-free / principal-
  derivation hypothesis — a JUDGED amendment, escalation input (do not self-ratify).

## LAP 194 (grind, lane D) — read-off `readoff_delta0_Zef2` DECOMPOSED to a SINGLE named residue `readoffD_trapped`; `sound0` + invariant PROVEN in `src`

Rung D (`OperatorZef2.lean:readoff_delta0_Zef2`) is no longer a monolithic `sorry`. It is now a
`readoffD_aux` reduction, and `readoffD_aux` is proven in `src` for **every** rule except a single
precisely-scoped sub-case. Landed in `src/GoodsteinPA/OperatorZef2.lean` (build 🟢 1328 jobs,
headline undrifted, `sound0`/`atomTrue_all_iff`/`atomTrue_ex_iff` axiom-clean):

- **`sound0` ported to `src`** (rank-0 `Zef2` soundness, the reusable truth core; axiom-clean).
- **`valm_nm` local lemma** — `Semiterm.valm ℕ ![] f (nm n) = n` for the `OperatorZinfty.nm`
  numeral, proven `by simp [nm]`. (Importing `GoodsteinPA.Embedding` to reuse its `valm_nm` was a
  DEAD END: it surfaces `Γ₀` parse-token clashes in existing proofs of `OperatorZef2` — avoided.)
- **`atomTrue_all_iff` / `atomTrue_ex_iff`** — `atomTrue (∀⁰χ) ↔ ∀k, atomTrue(χ/[nm k])` and the ∃
  dual; the ω-quantifier ↔ numeral-instances bridges the read-off descends on. Axiom-clean.
- **`readoffD_aux` (the strengthened FALSITY invariant)** — the key re-framing:
  `Zef2 α e H f 0 Γ → (∀ ψ∈Γ, ψ = ∃⁰φ ∨ ¬atomTrue ψ) → ∃ n ≤ f 0, atomTrue(φ/[nm n])`.
  PROVEN for `axL` (a true literal contradicts the all-false hyp), `wk`/`weak` (subset-inherit hyp,
  slot `f` fixed), `exI` (χ=φ: the introduced witness `n ≤ f 0` — either `φ/[nm n]` true (done) or
  recurse at slot `f`; χ≠φ: `∃⁰χ` false ⇒ `χ/[nm n]` false ⇒ recurse), `cut` (vacuous at rank 0),
  and the `allω` **non-trapped** branch (`∃⁰φ ∉ Γ₀` ⇒ pick a false branch, all members false ⇒
  `sound0` contradiction).
- **`readoff_delta0_Zef2` now PROVEN modulo `readoffD_trapped`** — the singleton hyp is `Or.inl rfl`.

### KEY FINDINGS (route-decisive, escalation-grade)

1. **The Δ₀ hypothesis `hφbdd` is NOT consumed by the read-off.** The falsity-invariant route needs
   no syntactic Δ₀ descent — `atomTrue` is total on ℕ, so "`= ∃⁰φ` or false" is self-maintaining
   through every rule with no Δ₀ premise. `hφbdd` is now an unused hypothesis of the ratified R-4
   statement (kept verbatim; only a linter warning). *Implication for the series-end judge:* the
   `<BoundedInstance> = DeltaZero` choice (lap 193) is harmless but not load-bearing for the read-off
   as proven; the real difficulty is entirely the slot-relativization residue below.

2. **The SOLE residue is `readoffD_trapped` — trapped contraction, `OperatorZef2.lean` (sorry).**
   At an `allω` node deriving `insert (∀⁰χ) Γ₀` with the goal existential `∃⁰φ ∈ Γ₀` (kept by a
   lower-`exI` contraction), branches run at `rel1 f n` (`rel1 f n 0 = f n`, NOT `f 0`), so the
   inductive witness bound is `≤ f n`, breaking the outer `≤ f 0`. **Concrete worst-case scenario
   (kernel-plausible, not yet a kernel counterexample):** a derivation may witness `∃⁰φ` ONLY deep
   inside an `allω` branch at bound `f n > f 0` (via `wk` to `{∃⁰φ, ∀⁰χ}` with `∀⁰χ` false, then
   `allω`, then `exI` on the trapped `∃⁰φ` at slot `rel1 f n`). Monotonicity of `f` does NOT rescue
   it (`f n ≥ f 0`, wrong direction). This is the Towsner §5.4 / Thm 17.1 clause-(ii) **growth-
   coupled** witnessing (`𝒢(n) > h_α(k)`), NOT a pure structural read-off — the bound is re-derived
   at each level via the ordinal descent + fast-growing domination, not propagated syntactically.

### NEXT (attack `readoffD_trapped`)
- **Option A (statement-shape / caller):** strengthen the read-off to carry a shape hypothesis that
  FORBIDS `∃⁰φ` from being trapped in an `allω` context (as `readoff_sigma1`'s `ReadoffShapeF`
  makes `allω` dead) — then the caller (the reduction exit) must establish it. Check whether the
  `rankToZero` exit derivation is contraction-free / principal enough to supply such a shape. This
  may be the intended factoring (mirrors the sigma1 template exactly).
- **Option B (growth-coupled):** thread the fast-growing separation (`hardy`/`fastGrowing` brackets,
  already banked) into the invariant à la Thm 17.1 clause (ii). Heavier; couples the read-off to the
  Part-2 lower bound. Likely > 1 lap.
- Decide A-vs-B by inspecting whether the pipeline's rank-0 exit derivation can carry a
  no-trap shape. If neither is clean, this is escalation input (the read-off statement may need a
  contraction-free / principal-derivation hypothesis added — a judged amendment, not self-ratified).

## LAP 193b (grind, lane D) — rank-0 soundness CORE `sound0` PROVEN (the hard Π/`allω` case); bounded-witness layer precisely scoped

`wip/Lap13ReadoffDeltaProbe.lean` (compiles clean, off-build) proves **`sound0`**:
`Zef2 α e H f 0 Γ → ∃ ψ ∈ Γ, atomTrue ψ` — rank-0 `Zef2` soundness. The genuine new content over the
atomic `readoff_sigma1_Zef` is the **`allω` (Π) combination**: for a `∀⁰` node, either some branch's
true member is in the shared context (return it), or every branch is true at its own instance ⇒
`∀⁰ φ` is true (`atomTrue (∀⁰ φ) = ∀ k, atomTrue (φ/[nm k])`, discharged via `eval_all`/`eval_substs`
+ `valm_nm` + `Matrix.constant_eq_singleton`). Slot-independent. The `exI`/`axL`/`cut` cases port
from `readoff_sigma1_Zef`. **`sound0` is the reusable truth core the full read-off calls.**

**Obstruction found + precisely scoped (the residual Towsner §5.4 content, ~1-2 laps):** the R-4
bound `∃ n ≤ f 0, atomTrue (φ/[nm n])` (E–W witnessing) is NOT a uniform inductive payload — the
attempted `sound0_bdd` (return, for an existential member, a witness `≤ f 0`) is **kernel-false**:
- **The witness bound is SLOT-LOCAL and `allω` relativizes the slot.** An `allω` conclusion is at
  slot `f`; its branches are at `rel1 f n` (`rel1 f n 0 = f n ≠ f 0`, and there is NO `Monotone f`).
  A context member extracted from branch `n` carries a witness `≤ f n`, not `≤ f 0`.
- A contracted `∃⁰ φ` can be TRAPPED in an `allω` branch's context and only re-`exI`'d deeper at a
  relativized slot (witness `≤ f k`).
So the bound layer must thread the LOCAL slot + a contraction/well-foundedness argument.
**Simplification banked:** for NON-contracted derivations of the singleton `{∃⁰ φ}`, `exI` keeps slot
`f` and `{∃⁰ φ}` has no `∀⁰` member (so `allω` never fires at top level) ⇒ the bound is immediate
from the top `exI`; the contraction case is the sole residue.

**NEXT:** (i) port `sound0` to `src` (reusable, will be consumed); (ii) build the bounded layer —
either a contraction-elimination lemma, or a `sound0`-variant returning a witness at the derivation's
OWN slot at 0 with a slot-monotone weakening only where valid; then specialize to R-4.

## LAP 193 (grind, lane D) — R-4 restatement DONE + `<BoundedInstance>` chosen (`DeltaZero`); read-off grind is next

Executed lane-D Stage-1 per the SERIES-1 order R-4 (the current src stub was still the stale
pre-R-4 `matrixTrue` form — it was never restated during the lane-P-focused SERIES-1 grind):

**Landed (build 🟢 1328, headline undrifted):**
- **`<BoundedInstance>` mini-probe committed** (`wip/Lap12BoundedInstanceProbe.lean`, compiles clean,
  order-required before any Stage-5 grind consumes the choice). Probed 2 candidates:
  (A) Foundation-native `LO.FirstOrder.Arithmetic.DeltaZero` (= `Hierarchy 𝚺 0`) — **ADOPTED**;
  (B) a repo-local calculus-exact ∀/∃-tower `QTower` — rejected (not repo-native; drops the Δ₀ bound).
  Key kernel-grounded finding recorded in the probe: the `Zeh`/`Zef2` core has only
  `axL`/`allω`/`exI`/`cut` — **no `∧`/`∨` rule** — so the read-off descends the instance through
  quantifiers/atoms only; `DeltaZero`'s `∧`/`∨` heads are DEAD branches for the singleton `{∃⁰ φ}`
  read-off (a singleton `{A ⋏ B}` is not `axL`-closable and has no ∧-rule ⇒ underivable).
- **`readoff_delta0_Zef2` restated** to the R-4 form (`OperatorZef2.lean:892`): hypothesis
  `hφbdd : ∀ n, DeltaZero (φ/[nm n])`, conclusion `∃ n ≤ f 0, atomTrue (φ/[nm n])`, body `sorry`.

**NEXT (the read-off discharge, ~1-2 laps):** induct on `dd` (mirror `readoff_sigma1_Zef` at
`OperatorZeh.lean:1823`). Cases `axL`/`wk`/`weak`/`exI`/`cut` port largely verbatim (the `cut` case
is vacuous at rank 0; `exI` picks the witness `n ≤ f 0`). **The genuine new content is the `allω`
(Π) case:** reading `atomTrue (∀⁰ χ) = ∀ k, Evalm (χ/[nm k])` off an `allω` node needs (i) each
branch to expose its matrix instance as the true disjunct, and (ii) the Δ₀ bound (`hφbdd`) to bound
the finitely-many load-bearing branches (Towsner §5.4). Likely needs a strengthened read-off
motive/`ReadoffShape`-analog for Δ₀ sequents (the singleton stays a quantifier tower as it descends,
so the shape invariant must carry "every member is a Δ₀ instance or a literal").

## LAP 192 (FRESH-MIND REVIEW) — lane B REFUTED; top-rank crux is a judge-owned TRILEMMA; productive lane = D

**Verdict:** the lap-191 top-rank-cut escalation is CORRECT (the pre-registered `rel1`/(f.1)
base-additivity wall fired). Two corrections to the LAP-11 block below:

**(1) Lane B ("PROOF-only resolution", scoped below) does NOT close — REFUTED this review.** Its
floor route needs the tight bound `ewN(∀-witness) ≤ f 0 + 1`. But:
- the reduction only delivers `ewN(∀-witness) ≤ g 0` where `g` is the **∀-slot** base — this is
  un-absorbable by the `2m+1` floor once `g` is `rel1`-plateau'd (the floor gives `g(f'0) ≥ 2f'0+1`,
  but `g 0` can exceed `f'0` by an unbounded margin);
- the tight bound is **not inductive**: `ewN(α+γ) ≤ ewN α + ewN γ` grows ADDITIVELY under the
  ratified `α+γ` output, while `collapse α = ω^α` absorbs the ordinal additively. A depth-`d` nest of
  top-rank cuts therefore blows `ewN(witness)` up to ~`2^d·(f0+1)` while the ∃-side base stays fixed.
  So passAux cannot carry `ewN(witness) ≤ f0+1`, and the "collapse-shaped ∀-premise is tight"
  observation fails at nesting depth ≥ 2. **Do NOT pursue lane B.**

**(2) The real obstruction is a TRILEMMA among three RATIFIED pillars.** Closing the node gate
`ewN(α+γ) ≤ g(f 0)` requires exactly one of:
- an **absorbing** norm `ewN(α+γ) = max(ewN α, ewN γ)` → closes trivially (`max(g0,f0) ≤ g(f0)`), but
  breaks the finite-fiber property that FORCED `ewN` over the CNF norm (T-Z7(i), lap 7);
- **base-additivity** `hg_base : ∀k, g0+k ≤ gk` of the ∀-slot → destroyed by `rel1 f n = f(max n·)`
  in nested ω-contexts (banked kernel-refutation `wip/Lap11CutFloorProbe.lean`); `rel1` max→+ recovers
  it only for *strictly* monotone `g`, which `ewIter` lacks (trap-8 plateau);
- a **non-additive output ordinal** → the `α+γ` output is fixed by ruling #1 (E–W Lemma 25).

Each fix touches a ratified pillar ⇒ **judge/architect-owned**. Prime amendment candidate to hand the
series-end judge: **does a finite-fibered ABSORBING norm exist?** (a `max`-based CNF height/rank has
infinite fibers, so this is a genuine open design question, not a trivial swap). The only sanctioned
crux move for a grind lap is a **wip-only** kernel probe of such a candidate → record to
`REBUILD-Z-SERIES-1-LEDGER.md`; NEVER port to `src`.

**MANDATE (grind laps):** work **lane D `readoff_delta0_Zef2`** (`OperatorZef2.lean:892`) — the sole
open PROOF-only lane, independent of the crux, on the headline path. See the LAP-11 lane-D notes.

## LAP 11 (191) — `passAux` 5/6 cases discharged; top-rank CUT hits the `hg_base` floor seam (kernel-refuted; ⚠️ lane B below REFUTED by lap-192 review — see top)

**Landed (green, axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`):** four of the five open
`passAux` sub-`sorry`s from the lap-189 handoff — **`exI`** (∃-node rebuild, bound `n ≤ ewIter f α 0`
via `ewIter_le_of_lt`), **`allω`** (ω-branch reassembly via `ewIter_rel1_le` + `ewIter_le_of_lt` into
`rel1 (ewIter f α) n`), **`cut` SUB-RANK** (`χ.complexity < c`: rebuild the cut at rank `c`, both
premises slot-lifted to the common `ewIter f α`). Also banked **`stepAllω_Zf2_bnd`** — the
bound-exposing (`δ ≤ P₁+P₂`) principal ∀/∃ reduction for the cut composition. `passAux` is now
**5/6**; only the TOP-RANK cut (`χ.complexity = c`) remains.

**The remaining crux — top-rank cut — and its seam (`wip/Lap11CutFloorProbe.lean`, kernel-clean):**
the designed discharge (IH-reduce both premises → `stepAllω_Zf2`) needs `hg_base : ∀k, g 0 + k ≤ g k`
on the reduced ∀-side slot `g = ewIter s βφ`. The pass threads only `Monotone ∧ infl ∧ (2m+1 ≤ s m)`
(chosen lap-189 for `rel1`-stability). **KERNEL-REFUTED that this entails `hg_base`:**
- `basefloor_not_rel1_stable`: `g = rel1 (2m+1) 3` has the full invariant but `g 0 + 1 = 8 > 7 = g 1`
  (the `max`-plateau eats the increment; the floor is relative-to-`g 0` and `g 0` JUMPS under `rel1`).
- `ewIter_one` (`ewIter s 1 = s∘s`) + `ewIter_one_floor_fails`: even at the PRINCIPAL-reachable `β=1`
  (ball `{δ<1}={0}`, no ball-growth) the floor fails — `ewIter gRel 1` inherits the plateau. **Kills
  the "ball-growth restores the floor at βφ≠0" escape.**

**Resolution lane to pursue NEXT (lane B in the probe — PROOF-only, no statement change):** re-gate
the reduction via the `2m+1` floor on `ewIter s βφ` (`g(f'0) ≥ 2 f'0 + 1`) + a TIGHT family-ordinal
bound `ewN α₁ ≤ s 0 + 1`, instead of `hg_base`. Then `ewN(α₁+γ') ≤ (s0+1)+f'0 ≤ 2 f'0+1 ≤ g(f'0)`
(using `f'0 ≥ s 0`). Requires (i) a floor-based re-proof of `cutReduceAllAuxRunning`'s gate discharge
and (ii) `passAux` to EXPOSE `ewN(witness) ≤ f 0 + 1`. **Open sub-problem (ii):** the tight bound is
inductive through `axL`/`wk`/`weak`/`exI`/`allω`/`cut`-sub-rank (collapse-shaped witness, `ewN α + 1
≤ f0+1` via node gate) but the top-rank `cut` OUTPUT has `ewN ~ 2(f0)+2` — so either relax the tight
bound for cut outputs, or show a principal cut's ∀-premise reduces to a collapse-shaped (tight-norm)
witness via its `allω`-headed spine. Decisive design question for next lap. If (ii) can't close →
escalate to the ledger (statement change, judge-gated). Do NOT self-ratify.

## LAP 9 (188) — reduction gate-composition crux SHARPENED: the obstruction is the `osucc` `+1`, kernel-proven irreducible under any `(f.1)-class` hypothesis (architect-owned)

Resumed with the judge asleep and lap-8 STOPPED for a ruling on two escalations. Rather than run
the designated fallback (rung R, plumbing over the pass `sorry`), attacked the route-decisive crux
head-on: **does pin-1 (`cutReduceAllAuxRunning_Zf2`) re-thread over `Zef2`?** The entrance's P-d
clause explicitly permits adding "(f.1)-class hypotheses as needed" to pins 1–2 without escalating,
so the live question was whether `EwF1`/`EwF2` on the two slots discharges the gate-composition trap
lap 8 isolated. **Answer, now KERNEL-GROUNDED: no.**

**The finding (`wip/Lap9GateProbe.lean`, both facts `#print axioms`-clean).** The reduction's fresh
`allω`/`cut`/`exI` node sits at `osucc (α + γ)` over slot `g ∘ f`; its `Zef2` gate is
`ewN (osucc (α+γ)) ≤ g (f 0)`, and by the banked `ewN_osucc_add_le` this is (in the saturating case)
`ewN α + ewN γ + 1 ≤ g (f 0)`. Available gates: `ewN α ≤ g 0`, `ewN γ ≤ f 0`.
- `noOsucc_closes`: WITHOUT the `+1` (i.e. an additive-norm output `ewN α + ewN γ`), `StrictMono g`
  ALONE closes it — `a ≤ g 0 → b ≤ f 0 → a + b ≤ g (f 0)`, because strict mono gives
  `g (f 0) ≥ g 0 + f 0` (the exact additive budget). So the growth bounds ARE enough for the sum.
- `osucc_plus_one_refutes`: WITH the `+1`, concrete `EwF1` slots refute it — `g 0 = 2`, `f 0 = 1`,
  `g (f 0) = g 1 = 3`, `a = 2 ≤ g 0`, `b = 1 ≤ f 0`, yet `a + b + 1 = 4 > 3`. The counterexample
  works because `EwF1` permits a *minimal* step `g 0 → g 1` (`gBad m = if m=0 then 2 else 2m+1`),
  leaving no room for the successor's `+1`. Reachable in the reduction: a premise ordinal can
  saturate `ewN(α+γ) = g(f0)` while `ewN α ≤ g0`, `ewN γ ≤ f0` (norms add via `ewN_add_le`), forcing
  the fresh node to `osucc(α+γ)` with `ewN = g(f0)+1`.

**Why no in-statement dodge (checked, not assumed).** `Zef2Prov (osucc(α+γ))` lets us root at any
`α' ≤ osucc(α+γ)`. `ewN` is NOT monotone, so a *larger* ordinal can have smaller `ewN` — but the
`osucc(α+γ)` ceiling is too tight to exploit it: when a premise reaches `α+γ` (successor case,
`γ = osucc βφ`, IH witness `= osucc(α+βφ) = α+γ`), the fresh node is forced to exactly `osucc(α+γ)`,
whose only sub-ceiling dominating the premise is itself. The `+1` is intrinsic to a single cut
producing a strictly larger ordinal against a *fixed* base `g(f0)` with no growth slack.

**The fix is statement-level (architect-owned; escalation SHARPENED, not resolved).** Two candidates,
both a redesign VOID to self-ratify:
  (a) an output ordinal whose `ewN` is exactly additive (natural-sum / Hessenberg shape) so no `+1` —
      then `noOsucc_closes` shows `StrictMono g` suffices; but `Ordinal.nadd` was deleted at v4.31
      (`mathlib-nadd-removed-v431.md`) and ONote has no natural sum, so ~bespoke (~700 lines).
  (b) a gate that absorbs the norm into the slot ARGUMENT (`f (ewN α + ·)`, the genuine E–W design in
      `ewStep`: `K = f (ewN α + m)`) instead of comparing to the fixed base `f 0` — but the headline
      read-off (`headline_readoff`) needs the base-0 witness bound `n ≤ f 0`, so this trades one
      invariant for another and must be re-reconciled against the exit.

**Advance vs lap 8:** lap 8 said "cross-gate `ewN α ≤ f 0` unavailable → escalate." Lap 9 proves the
deeper fact: *even granting the cross-gate's growth content via `EwF1 f ∧ EwF1 g`, the pin is
kernel-false*, because the defect is the successor `+1`, not the growth relation. The judge's ruling
#1 (verdict §5) can now be made precisely: EITHER accept an additive-norm output ordinal (fix a),
OR redesign the gate to argument-absorbing (fix b). No third option survives the counterexample.

**NEXT (this lap or next, in-authority, wip-only):** if wanting to pre-scope fix (a): prototype an
ONote additive-norm combinator `α ⊕ γ` with `ewN (α ⊕ γ) = ewN α + ewN γ` and strict domination
`β < γ → α ⊕ β < α ⊕ γ`, in `wip/`, to hand the architect a ready splice. Do NOT edit `Zef2` /
`cutReduceAllAuxRunning_Zf2` statements (VOID). Rung R (`rankToZero_Zef2`) remains the plumbing
fallback but stays sorry-tainted (consumes the pass pin) and does not touch this crux.

---

## LAP 6 (186) — item 1 DISCHARGED (`iterSlot_monotone`); item 2 → candidate TRAP 8 (architect-gated)

Ran the ratified laps-6–7 order (`E-2026-07-02-JUDGE-rebuild-z-lap5-validation.md` §5).

- **Item 1 DONE (committed `c39f08e`):** the disclosed C5 pin `iterSlot_monotone` is now a real,
  sorry-free, axiom-clean proof (`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`), mirroring
  `hardy_monotone` on the diagonalizing `iterSlot`. Added the base-`f` value-transfer lemma
  `iterSlot_le_of_reaches` (mirror of `hardy_le_of_reaches`; successor arg-shift `x → f x` absorbed
  by inflationarity), the limit case riding `fastGrowing_bachmann_reach` exactly as `hardy_monotone`.

- **Item 2 (the pass induction on `cutElimPass_Zf`) → candidate EIGHTH statement trap; ESCALATED,
  NOT self-ratified** (`REBUILD-Z-TRAP8-2026-07-02.md`; kernel probe `wip/Trap8Probe.lean`, compiles
  clean). The **locked** bare output slot `iterSlot f α` is NOT ordinal-monotone —
  `iterSlot f 2 0 = 3 > 2 = iterSlot f ω 0` (dips at a limit base, riding `ω[0] = 1`). Every
  induction case with a `β < α` sub-derivation (`weak`/`exI`/`allω`/`cut`) must lift its slot
  `iterSlot f β` up to `iterSlot f α` via `Zef.mono_f` (slots only RAISE), needing
  `iterSlot f β ≤ iterSlot f α` — kernel-false. **Statement-intrinsic** (output slot rigidly
  `iterSlot f α`; `ZefProv` slackens only the height — see the root-`exI` argument in the doc §3).
  Root cause: trap-7's diagonalization fix bought `allω`-branch large-argument domination at the
  cost of base-argument smallness, which now bites at `weak`/`exI`/`cut` (slot read near arg 0).
  **NEXT (architect/judge):** amend C2's output slot to a positive-budget / relativized read
  (`rel1 (iterSlot f α) K` or `fun x => iterSlot f α (K+x)`) so `iterSlot_le_of_reaches`
  monotonicity applies at every node; then re-check the C3 exit consumes the count and re-open the
  grind. Grind laps must NOT touch C2 (VOID). `iterSlot_monotone` + `iterSlot_le_of_reaches` carry
  over to any fix. **Do NOT re-attempt the bare-`iterSlot f α` pass induction** (kernel-refuted here).

  **Sharpened + crux lemma banked (same lap, `ac775ab`/next commit):** (i)
  `no_fixed_arg_monotone_unbounded_slot` (`wip/Trap8Probe.lean`) proves NO fixed-argument slot
  works (monotone ⊕ unbounded is impossible: `ofNat n < ω ∀n` ⟹ `n ≤ S ω ∀n`), so the fix must make
  the slot-READ node-relative, not swap the iterate. (ii) `iterSlot_le_of_lt` (src §5b, axiom-clean)
  = the budgeted ordinal-monotonicity `β<α, x ≥ norm β ⟹ iterSlot f β x ≤ iterSlot f α x` (mirror
  `hardy_le_of_lt`) — the crux lemma any node-relative fix splices in. (iii) **Budget refinement**
  (`trap8_budget_not_norm_alpha`): the node-relative read-budget canNOT be `norm α` — `norm` is not
  monotone (`ofNat 5 < ω` yet `norm ω = 1 < 5 = norm(ofNat 5)`), and `iterSlot_le_of_lt` needs
  argument `≥ norm β` for a child `β < α`; the budget must DOMINATE sub-derivation norms, i.e. be the
  E–W count `F^α(0)`, not `norm α`. The trap-8 analysis thus lands exactly on E–W Lemma 19's design
  (transfinite count, not syntactic norm). **NEXT grind lap (wip-only, in-authority):** define the
  count `Cα := F^{collapse α}(0)`-class (candidate `fastGrowing (collapse α) 0` or a `norm`-majorizing
  count) and prove the majorization `∀ β reachable below α at budget x, norm β ≤ Cα` — the budget
  the node-relative slot routes through. THEN prototype the node-relative pass in `wip/`
  (slot `rel1 (iterSlot f α) Cα`) threading `weak`/`exI`/`cut` via `iterSlot_le_of_lt` + `allω` via
  reaches. This is the architect's C2 shape decision (do NOT put a chosen shape in `src` — VOID).

## LAP 5 (185) — PIN-3 RESTATED (statement lap done) → judge-gated grind is the open work

The lap-5 STATEMENT deliverables are DONE and committed (`435ed72`): pin 3 `cutElimPass_Zf` is
restated per the entrance-lock C1–C2, `collapse`/`iterCount`/`iterSlot` are defined against ONote
with all five C5 lemmas proven, and the C3 anti-vacuity corollary `cutElimPass_exit_root` typechecks
with the count-bearing bound. The run STOPPED for the judge (`REBUILD-Z-LAP5-VERDICT.md`). The open
work is **judge-gated laps 6–7** (the pass grind); nothing else is permitted this run.

### The pin-3 restatement (the live crux, `src/GoodsteinPA/OperatorZeh.lean`)

```
cutElimPass_Zf : Zef α e H f (c+1) Γ → e.NF → α.NF → Cl H α →
    Monotone f → (∀ x, x ≤ f x) → ZefProv (collapse α) e H (iterSlot f α) c Γ    -- body sorry
```
with `collapse α = ω^α`, `iterSlot f α = f^[norm α + 1]`. Sole `src` §5 sorry.

### NEXT (laps 6–7, AFTER judge ratification of the lap-5 verdict) — the pass grind

- Induction on the `Zef` derivation `D`. Structural cases (`axL`/`wk`/`weak`) thread.
- **`∃`-cut lane** (`cut` case): compose the two premise iterates via `iter_comp` (counts ADD);
  `iterSlot`'s count on the combined ordinal must dominate the summed sub-counts (`norm`-arithmetic
  on `osucc (βφ + βψ)`).
- **`allω` lane** (THE hard pole, T-Z5(iii)): branch `n` slot is `rel1 (iterSlot f (β n)) n`; the
  per-branch count `iterCount (β n) = norm (β n) + 1` grows with `n`. The E–W Lemma 19/20 arithmetic
  (`N(α) ≤ f^[iterCount α] 0`) is the obligation — whether `norm · + 1` is a large-enough count is
  the live risk. If kernel-obstructed, ESCALATE (architect swaps the count/collapse normal form; do
  NOT grind the body).
- Gate every lap: build 🟢 + headline `#print axioms` undrifted + `blueprint_audit` PASSES.

### Banked carriers the grind reuses (all axiom-clean, `src`)

- Iterate bricks: `iter_monotone`/`iter_infl`/`iter_normControlled`/`iter_le_of_le`/`iter_comp` (§5b).
- C5 lemmas: `collapse_NF`/`collapse_strictMono`/`iterSlot_monotone`/`iterSlot_infl`/`iterSlot_zero`.
- `rel1_comp` (`allω` reassembly), `normControlled_comp_running` (fixed-control conjunct), the `Zef`
  inversion suite + `ZefProv.cut`/`exI`/`allω` combinators.
- E–W Lemma 19 ordinal-side arithmetic banked in `src/GoodsteinPA/Hardy.lean` (`hardy_add_le_comp`,
  `hardy_omega_pow_*`) — the ordinal domination inputs the `allω` count arithmetic will need.

## LAP 4 (184) REVIEW — SLOT-JUDGMENT AMENDMENT RATIFIED → the PORT is the open work

The lap-3 "awaiting architect ratification" stall is RESOLVED by review-lap authority
(`REBUILD-Z-LAP4-RATIFICATION-2026-07-02.md`): LOCK §1-A1/§3 amended to the function-slot judgment
`Zef` (the R4-compliant form the wip kernel-verified). The math for pins 1–2 + read-off is DONE in
`wip/ZefSlotCalculus.lean` (all `[propext,choice,Quot.sound]`). The remaining work is the staged
`src` port. **CURRENT DIRECTIVE (DIRECTION.md lap-184 block) is binding.**

### SLOT-JUDGMENT PORT — decomposition (each step ends GREEN; gate: build 🟢 + headline no-drift + §6 seams)

- **P1 — DONE (lap 184).** `Zef` inductive + `Zef.weakening`/`mono_f`/`change_H`/`mono_Hf` +
  `ZefProv` (+ `of`/`mono`/`weakening`) + slot algebra (`rel1_monotone`/`rel1_infl`/`reslot_family`/
  `reslot_exside`) + `allInv_Zef` are now live in `src/GoodsteinPA/OperatorZeh.lean` §7 (inlined
  verbatim from `wip/ZefSlotCalculus.lean`, which is now SUPERSEDED — it no longer compiles
  standalone due to the duplicate `Zef`, harmless since it is off the build). Build 🟢 1333.
- **P2 — DONE (lap 184).** `redDeriv_slot` (FULL §19.6 running-family reduction, output slot `g∘f`)
  + `stepAllω_Zef` are live src theorems, axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`
  (verified real `#print axioms`). The read-off exit `readoff_sigma1_Zef`/`headline_readoff_Zef`
  ported too (bound `f 0`). **These are the discharge machinery for pins 1–2, now in the live build.**
- **P3 — DONE (lap 184). PINS 1–2 DISCHARGED.** The §5 stage pins + the stage `redDeriv` gap-proof
  were deleted; the §7 slot workhorses were renamed to the pin names, so `cutReduceAllAuxRunning_Zf`
  (pin 1) and `stepAllω_Zf` (pin 2) are now **real sorry-free theorems** in the `Zef` slot judgment
  (output slot `g∘f`), verified `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`. Seam-1 rebuilt as the
  slot corollary `probe_cut_all_arm_Zf` (green); seam-2 (`probe_allomega_reassembly_Zf`) +
  non-vacuity (`two_level_config_Zeh`) untouched + green. `principal_witness_exceeds_stage` kept as
  the documented LOCK-§1-A1 obstruction lemma. Build 🟢 1333, headline NO DRIFT. Only `sorry` left
  in OperatorZeh = pin 3 `cutElimPass_Zf` (forbidden).
- **P4 — read-off ported + embedding bridge DONE (lap 184); residual = optional retirement.**
  `readoff_sigma1_Zef` / `headline_readoff_Zef` (slot form, bound `f 0`) are live in §7. **The
  embedding bridge `zeh_to_zef : Zeh α e H m c Γ → Zef α e H (rel1 (hardy e) m) c Γ` is PROVEN**
  (§8, axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`; `rel1_rel1` helper): every stage-`m`
  derivation is a slot derivation at the canonical slot `rel1 (hardy e) m` (root `f 0 = hardy e m`,
  read-off bound preserved) — the kernel witness that the lap-184 amendment is a CONSERVATIVE
  generalization (nothing the stage calculus proved is lost). **Blueprint ledger updated (lap 184):**
  pins 1–2 now carry `clean` `goodstein_blueprint` attributes (nodes 12/13); `lake exe
  blueprint_audit` PASSES (13 nodes, claimed=computed=clean, exit 0). **§6 seam migration COMPLETE
  (lap 184):** all three §6 probes now live in the slot calculus — seam-1 `probe_cut_all_arm_Zf`,
  seam-2 `probe_allomega_reassembly_Zef`, non-vacuity `two_level_config_Zef` (§8b, all axiom-clean);
  the cut-elimination assembly (laps 5–7) now has its test infrastructure in the target calculus.
  **NOTE: `Zeh` CANNOT be fully retired** — pin 3 (`cutElimPass_Zf`) is stated over `Zeh`, and its
  restatement is FORBIDDEN (lap-5 gate); the stage-form probes + read-off stay as `Zeh` companions
  until pin 3's lap-5 restatement. So `Zeh`/`Zef` coexist by design.

  **`Zef` inversion suite COMPLETE (lap 184):** `allInv_Zef` + the three propositional inversions
  `orInv_Zef` / `andInvL_Zef` / `andInvR_Zef` (§8c, ported from the `Zeh` suite, all axiom-clean) —
  the cut-elimination assembly (laps 5–7) now has its full inversion toolkit in the target calculus.

  **`Zef` assembly plumbing COMPLETE (lap 184, §8d):** `Zef.mono_c` (cut-rank monotonicity) + the
  `ZefProv` wrapper combinators (`cut`/`exI`/`allω`) — the structural layer the assembly reuses to
  introduce cuts / rebuild ω-nodes (all axiom-clean; reuse the `Zeh`-agnostic ONote splice bricks).

  **PERMITTED SCOPE NOW EXHAUSTED for this run.** The `Zef` slot substrate is fully built out and
  ready for the cut-elimination assembly: calculus + `mono_f`/`change_H`/`mono_Hf` + `ZefProv` +
  reduction pins 1–2 (discharged) + full inversion suite (`allInv`/`orInv`/`andInvL`/`andInvR`) +
  §6 seam probes + wrapper combinators (`cut`/`exI`/`allω`) + `mono_c` + the `zeh_to_zef` bridge.
  The ONLY open obligation is **pin 3** (`cutElimPass_Zf`) — the E–W Lemma 30 collapse/iteration
  pass — which is operator-FORBIDDEN (lap-5 gate; its `∃ f'` is kernel-vacuous, faithful restatement
  = iterate `f ↦ f^{Fω α}` + control raise, requires ratification). Its iterate-domination inputs
  are banked (`hardy_add_le_comp`, E–W Lemma 19). The assembly + Δ₀ read-off + integration all sit
  behind that gate. **Next real advance = pin 3's restatement (altitude/judge deliverable), not a
  grind-lap task this run.**

### After the port: the live REBUILD-Z crux is now PIN 3 (`cutElimPass_Zf`) — but it stays the
### lap-5 entrance gate (statement mini-lock, discharge FORBIDDEN until its restatement is ratified).
The banked growth-lane bricks (`hardy_add_le_comp`, E–W Lemma 19 `hardy_omega_pow_lt_fastGrowing`)
are pin-3's iterate-domination inputs. Pin 3's `∃ f'` is kernel-vacuous; its faithful restatement
(iterate `f ↦ f^{Fω α}`, control raise) is the lap-5 deliverable — do NOT grind it as written.

**Watch-outs:** (1) src `Zeh` carries MORE than the wip minimal clone (read-off, seams, `mono_H`,
blueprint attributes) — P3/P4 must re-key all of them. (2) The composition order is `g∘f` in pin
naming (E–W's `f∘g` under the swapped f/g labelling); the src pins currently say `f∘g` — that is
the kernel-refuted order, fix it. (3) `rel1_comp` (`OperatorZeh.lean:642`) is the `allω` reassembly
brick — already banked. (4) Keep the discharged 2nd conjunct route (`normControlled_comp_running`)
but with roles swapped for `g∘f`.

**Still FORBIDDEN:** pin 3 (`cutElimPass_Zf`), Route-A, Δ₀ read-off extension.

## LAP 3 (183) — pins 1–2 PROVEN PROVABLE in the slot calculus; permitted lane MINED, awaiting architect ratification

The lap-2 gap (below) is **DISSOLVED**.  `wip/ZefSlotCalculus.lean` carries the complete
resolution-(2) slot calculus `Zef` (`Zeh` with stage `m` → carried slot `f : ℕ → ℕ`, `exI` bound
`n ≤ f 0`, `allω` branch `rel1 f n`) with the FULL E–W chain **end-to-end, all sorry-free /
axiom-clean** (`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`):
- `redDeriv_slot` — the running-family cut-reduction (the lap-2 "unprovable" gap; output slot
  **`g∘f`**, NOT `f∘g` — the pins' order was backwards, `reslot_fog_FAILS` kernel-refutes it).
- `allInv_Zef` — ∀-inversion (feeds the reduction from a ∀-side derivation).
- `stepAllω_Zef` — pin 2 (invert ∀-side → reduction).
- `readoff_sigma1_Zef` / `headline_readoff_Zef` — the §3 EXIT (witness ≤ `f 0`, = E–W Lemma 31).
- lap-3 numeric probe `wip/ZefResolutionProbe.lean` (the `g∘f` decision).

**So pins 1–2 are proven provable.**  The remaining work is NON-math and OUT-OF-LANE for a grind
lap: the architect's **LOCK §1 amendment** (adopt the slot judgment: carry `f`, `exI` bound
`n ≤ f 0`, `allω` branch `rel1 f n`, pins output `g∘f`; `NormControlled` slots are
monotone+inflationary = the two carried side conditions) + the mechanical `Zeh → Zef` `src`
migration behind ratification (the `wip` proofs port verbatim modulo namespace).

**Permitted lane status:** MINED.  The slot calculus's remaining E–W piece is the cut-ELIMINATION
pass (Lemmas 26/27/30) = pin 3's territory = FORBIDDEN (lap-5 gate).  Route-A / Δ₀ extension
FORBIDDEN.  So further `src` progress on pins 1–2 is judge-gated; a resumed lap with no ratification
should confirm state (build 🟢, headline no drift) and end, or extend orthogonal `wip` evidence
only.  The math obstruction the escalation flagged is GONE.

Findings: `REBUILD-Z-LAP3-FINDING-2026-07-02-gof-order-resolves-slot-reduction.md`;
baton `HANDOFF-2026-07-02-lap183.md`.

### Full open-item inventory (lap 183, per how-to-get-unblocked)

Every open axiom/sorry the headline could rest on, and its gate status under the CURRENT
DIRECTIVE (2026-07-02 REBUILD-Z, laps 2–4 = pins 1–2 only):

| open item | route | status |
|---|---|---|
| pins 1–2 (`cutReduceAllAuxRunning_Zf`, `stepAllω_Zf`) | B / REBUILD-Z | **PROVEN PROVABLE** this lap (slot calculus); src discharge = LOCK §1 amendment (architect) |
| pin 3 (`cutElimPass_Zf`, cut-ELIMINATION / E–W L30 collapse) | B / REBUILD-Z | **FORBIDDEN until lap-5 restatement (judge-gated)** — the next feasibility-in-doubt crux |
| `wainer_bound_of_pa_proves_goodstein` | B (target) | reached via the full pipeline (embed + cut-elim + classification); gated behind pin 3 |
| `goodstein_implies_consistency` | A (headline girder) | **FORBIDDEN as mainline** |
| `exists_sigma1_descending_step`, `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty`, Crux2Blueprint residuals | A | **FORBIDDEN** |
| Δ₀ read-off extension | B | **FORBIDDEN (laps 8–10)** |

So the permitted lane (pins 1–2) is MINED; every sibling is DIRECTION-forbidden (not merely hard).

### NEXT CRUX = pin 3 (cut-elimination), when the lap-5 gate opens — three concrete attack paths

The E–W collapse (Lemma 30: `f,F ⊢^α_{Ω+1} Γ ⟹ ⊢^{F^α(0)}_{F^α(0)} Γ`, updates `f^{F^α(0)+1},
F^{α+1}`) is where the control raises and the slot iterates — the feasibility-in-doubt piece and
the ε₀-girder locus.  Concrete attacks (build in `wip/ZefSlotCalculus.lean` once the gate opens):
1. **Predicative rank-step first (E–W L26/L27 shadow, smallest non-trivial case).** Prove ONE
   rank-lowering pass `Zef α e H f (c+1) Γ → ZefProv α' (raise e α') H f' c Γ` by induction on the
   derivation, applying `redDeriv_slot`/`stepAllω_Zef` at each top-rank (complexity-`c`) cut; the
   non-cut cases thread.  Determine `α'` (E–W: `ω^α`-ish) and `f'` (the iterate `f^{F^α(0)+1}`)
   from the bookkeeping — THIS pins pin 3's correct restatement (the lap-5 deliverable, replacing
   the vacuous `∃ f'`).  The reduction bricks are DONE; this is their assembly.
2. **Slot-iterate arithmetic.** Prove `f'` is `NormControlled`/monotone/inflationary at the raised
   control (`hardy`-iterate domination; the banked `hardy_add_le_comp` = `H_{e+β} ≤ H_e∘H_β` is the
   composition brick, `wip/HardyAddProbe.lean` + `src/Hardy.lean`).  Feeds path 1's `f'` conjunct.
3. **Read-off closes the pipeline (already DONE for the exit).** After cut-elim to rank 0,
   `readoff_sigma1_Zef` (this lap) reads `witness ≤ f' 0` = E–W L31.  So paths 1–2 + the banked
   exit = the full slot-calculus pipeline; only the collapse bookkeeping (path 1) is open.

Why blocked NOW: pin 3 is DIRECTION-forbidden until its lap-5 restatement (judge-gated).  Not a
fixation, not a difficulty wall — an explicit scope prohibition.  When the gate opens, path 1 is
the first move.

### UPDATE (lap 183) — pin-3 SLOT SHAPE determined (kernel-grounded), iterate carrier banked

`wip/ZefCutElim.lean` (sorry-free, axiom-clean) banks the E–W numeric-slot ITERATE `f^[k]`
(`Function.iterate`) infrastructure — `iter_monotone`, `iter_infl`, `iter_normControlled`,
`iter_le_of_le`, `iter_comp` (`f^[j]∘f^[k]=f^[j+k]`) — the carrier pin 3's `f'` must be pinned to.

**Finding (attempting `cutElimPass` in the slot calculus):** pin 3's output slot is the
ORDINAL-COUNT iterate, NOT the draft's free `∃ f'` (vacuous, Q2) AND NOT a plain `f^[k]`:
- a top-rank `∃`-cut composes premise iterates `f^[k₁]∘f^[k₂] = f^[k₁+k₂]` (`iter_comp`) — count
  ADDS, stays an iterate (confirms Q2's pinned-iterate);
- but the `allω` node has ℕ-many branches with per-branch counts `kₙ` and NO finite `max kₙ`
  (branch-unbounded — the SPIKE-W4B demand), so the slot must be the RELATIVIZED ordinal-indexed
  iterate `f^[F^α(0)]` (E–W Lemma 19), coupling the numeric slot to the ordinal operator.

So the lap-5 pin-3 restatement is
`cutElimPass_Zf : Zef α e H f (c+1) Γ → ZefProv (collapse α) e H (f^[Fω α]) c Γ`
(`collapse` = E–W L30 ordinal collapse `F^α(0)`; `Fω` = the matching iterate count, L19/20).  The
OPEN hard part is the ordinal-collapse arithmetic (`collapse`, `Fω`) — the ε₀ girder (E–W L19/20/
26/27/30).  path 1 above is refined by this: the slot is `f^[Fω α]`, not a plain `∃ k`.

## LAP 2 (REBUILD-Z laps 2–4 gate-open) — pins 1–2 reduced to ONE localized gap; candidate SIXTH trap → ESCALATED (SUPERSEDED by LAP 3 above)

Gate-open work (DIRECTION 2026-07-02 laps 2–4): discharge pins 1–2
(`cutReduceAllAuxRunning_Zf`, `stepAllω_Zf`) against the judge-AMENDED fixed-control §5
statements in `src/GoodsteinPA/OperatorZeh.lean`.  **Both pins are now sorry-FREE modulo ONE
precisely-characterized obstruction.**  Build 🟢 1333, headline no drift, §6 seam probes green.

**Banked axiom-clean (`[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`):**
- `Zeh.change_H` — operator irrelevance (R1 in-kernel; `Cl_of_NF` makes `H` freely replaceable
  both ways). Dissolves all operator threading in the reduction.
- `normControlled_comp_running` — the `NormControlled (f∘g) e m` conjunct of pins 1–2, DISCHARGED
  (judge Q1; no inflationarity hyp — `g`-control ⟹ `g` inflationary via `le_hardy`).
- `principal_witness_exceeds_stage` — `m < hardy ω m` (the gap's root, fifth-trap analog).

**Reduction skeleton (`sorryAx`, gap disclosed):**
- `redDeriv` — full §19.6 running-family cut-reduction (induction on ∃-side D, mirrors banked
  `Zekd.cutReduceAllAux`, norm deleted, `(k,d)`→stage `m`). EVERY case closes except the
  principal `exI` (2 subcases, same wall).
- pin 1 body = `⟨redDeriv …, normControlled_comp_running hg hf⟩`.
- pin 2 body = `allInv_Zeh` → running family → pin 1 (the `probe_cut_all_arm_Zf` construction),
  Q3-unified, both conjuncts assembled.

**The gap (candidate SIXTH statement trap):** in the principal `exI`, the cut of the inverted
family member `fam n` (inherently at stage `max m₀ n` — `allInv_Zeh` returns the `n`-th ω-premise,
`allω` bakes running stage into branches) lands the output at stage `max m n`, and `Zeh` has NO
stage-lowering rule (LOCK §1 A1). Need `n ≤ m`; only have `n ≤ hardy e m` with `hardy e m > m` at
`e = ω`. Root: E–W cut-reduction COMPOSES the witness bound (`f∘g`, Lemma 25); the `Zeh` judgment's
single `hardy e m` `exI` bound cannot express a composed bound at a fixed stage. Option A repaired
the CONTROL axis (correctly) but left the STAGE axis tied to input `m`, inheriting
`OperatorZinfty.lean:766–773`'s "witness-budget" wall.

**DECISIVE DIAGNOSIS (kernel-proven):** `wip/RedDerivFixedStageProbe.lean` = `redDeriv` verbatim
with the ONE change that the family is at FIXED stage `m₀` (not `max m₀ n`) — it closes
**sorry-free**, axiom `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`. So the running stage is the SOLE culprit;
the fix must give the reduction a fixed-stage inverted family (or a function-valued witness bound,
or route around).

**ESCALATED** (LOCK: believe a gated form wrong → STOP + writeup, do not improvise):
`REBUILD-Z-LAP2-FINDING-2026-07-02-fixed-stage-reduction-wall.md`. Proposed resolutions (judge/
architect call): (1) grow output stage (likely ⇒ iterate, not clean); (2) function-valued `exI`
bound in the judgment (LOCK §1 change, faithful E–W); (3) BW87 fallback (P1: full cut-elim + read
off, pin-3/lap-5 territory). **Do NOT grind the gap as written** — it is unprovable for `e > 0`.

**NEXT (resume trigger = judge ruling on which resolution):** if (3)/BW87, the running-family
reduction is bypassed and the work moves to `cutElimPass_Zf` (pin 3, lap-5 entrance mini-lock); if
(2), the Z1 judgment form reopens (architect); if (1), restate pins 1–2 output stage and re-thread
`redDeriv` (the skeleton ports — only the two principal-`exI` sorries change to the grown stage).

## DONE (lap 181) — Aristotle headline faithfulness cross-check → PASS

Sanctioned NL→formalization faithfulness audit of the headline (permitted, non-gated, touches no §5
pin / no Route-A). Job `f56c8524` (`Build: succeeded`, single intended `sorry`) formalized the
Kirby–Paris PROSE independently (never shown the repo Lean) and landed on
`∃ φ, DefinesGoodsteinGraph φ ∧ ¬ PAProves (goodsteinSentenceOf φ)` over PA⁻+full-induction, with
concrete `goodsteinSeq` (base `k+2`, hereditary-bump-minus-1) and the graph-definability anti-vacuity
anchor. **Adjudicated logically equivalent** to `peano_not_proves_goodstein : 𝗣𝗔 ⊬ ↑goodsteinSentence`
(the repo's fixed-sentence + proven `Bridge.lean` form is the stronger/more-specific variant of the
same claim). Verdict banked: `REBUILD-Z-LAP181-FAITHFULNESS-2026-07-02.md`. LOCKED anchors stand; no
audit-surface action. Do NOT resubmit this cross-check.

## DONE (lap 180) — additive-Hardy INEQUALITY banked in `src/`

**The lap-180 review's named permitted brick is CLOSED.** Lap 178 refuted the additive-Hardy
*equality* `H_{e+β}=H_e∘H_β` (absorption); the surviving **inequality** is now proven axiom-clean
(`[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`, build 🟢 1333, no headline drift) in `src/GoodsteinPA/Hardy.lean`:

> **`hardy_add_le_comp`** : for NF `e, β`, all `x`: `hardy (e + β) x ≤ hardy e (hardy β x)`.
> **`hardy_add_omega_pow_le`** (P1 corollary): `hardy (e + ω^α) x ≤ hardy e (hardy (ω^α) x)`.
> Helpers: `hardy_oadd0` (`H_{ω^0·p}=·+p`), `hardy_single_coeff` (coeff-as-iterate, ℕ+),
> `hardy_coeff_add` (coefficient additivity `H_{ω^e·(m+n)}=H_{ω^e·m}∘H_{ω^e·n}`).

Proof: induction on `e` matching ONote `+`'s `addAux` recursion; with `s = a₁+β = oadd e' n' a'`,
case split `cmp e₁ e'` = lt (e absorbed: IH + `le_hardy` + tail-peel) / gt (concat: tail-peel + IH +
monotone) / eq (coeff merge: tail-peels + `hardy_coeff_add`/`hardy_oadd0` + IH). **No ordinal-absorption
argument was needed** — the earlier "partial absorption is the hard part" worry dissolved: the eq case
rewrites `a₁+β = oadd e' n' a'` (from cmp) and applies coefficient additivity directly.

**Consumer (judge-gated, do NOT wire in Scope-A):** the P1 obligation
`NormControlled (f∘g) (raise e α) m` bounds `hardy (e+ω^α)`; `hardy_add_omega_pow_le` +
`hardy_omega_pow_lt_fastGrowing` (banked lap 179) reduce it to `hardy e ∘ f_α`, a composition the
f-slot carries. This is the last calculus-independent brick the discharge needs; the remaining work
(actually filling `cutElimPass_Zf`/`cutReduceAllAuxRunning_Zf` with it) IS reduction discharge —
FORBIDDEN until the judge ratifies `REBUILD-Z-LAP1-VERDICT.md`. **The permitted growth lane is now
genuinely exhausted** (E–W Lemma 19 + additive bridge both banked).

## CRITICAL-PATH CRUX MAP (lap 179 refresh — unblock-playbook §2.5/§3)

**The crux** = `wainer_bound_of_pa_proves_goodstein` (`WainerRoute.lean:118`), i.e. originating the
Gentzen ε₀ ordinal analysis of PA in Lean via the `Zeh` operator-controlled calculus. Feasibility is
in genuine doubt (unprecedented Lean milestone). **It is BLOCKED by an external governance gate, not
a fixation:** REBUILD-Z-ORDER permits treadmill laps Scope-A ONLY; reduction discharge + all
`OperatorZeh` §5 pins + the operator-controlled substrate are FORBIDDEN until the judge ratifies
`REBUILD-Z-LAP1-VERDICT.md`. So the honest lap loop is: advance the crux's *permitted* pure-growth
sub-bricks, keep the build green, and await the judge.

Full open-inventory (this lap): every `src/` sorry is either FORBIDDEN Route-A/Crux2 machinery
(`Crux2Blueprint`, `InternalZ/Grz/Ig/ONote/Cor34`, `Embedding(X)`, `Descent*`, `Reduction`, `Thm56`,
`Bridge`) or judge-gated (`OperatorZeh` 12, `Statement` audit surface). `Hardy`/`Domination` are
sorry-FREE (their "sorry" hits are docstring text). No permitted, non-gated `src/` sorry remains.

Three paths on the crux (all judge-gated until lap-1 ratification — do NOT execute in Scope-A):
1. **f-slot carriage** (LOCK §6, not-locked): thread the composed control through the reduction so
   `exI` bounds re-establish at the raised control. Needs the f-slot reduction/step signatures.
2. **Per-instance headline discharge**: `e` is concrete at the read-off, so P1 is a fixed-`(e,m)`
   arithmetic bound there; uses the banked `hardy_omega_pow_lt_fastGrowing` + `hardy_le_fastGrowing`.
3. **BW87 cut-free fallback**: don't thread — eliminate cuts (ordinal towers) and read off with
   `readoff_sigma1` (needs the P2 Δ₀ matrix extension, ORDER laps 8–10).

Permitted pure-growth sub-bricks (the only Scope-A-legal lane): the P1 UPPER bound is now BANKED
(lap 179, see below), AND its matching LOWER half — completing the **two-sided E–W Lemma 19 bracket**
`fastGrowing α n ≤ hardy(ω^α) n < fastGrowing α (n+1)` (`hardy_omega_pow_bracket`, `Hardy.lean`,
`[propext,choice,Quot.sound]`; lower = `fastGrowing_le_hardy_omega_pow`, WF recursion: α=0 trivial,
limit = IH verbatim, successor = iterate domination via `hardy_oadd_coeff` + `iterate_le_iterate_of_le`
+ `le_hardy`). The Hardy hierarchy is now kernel-proven sandwiched by consecutive fast-growing values
at every `ω^α`. Remaining candidates are thin and of uncertain reuse:
- `f_α ≤ f_{ω^α}` (via `Reaches x (oadd α 1 0) α`) — **assessed hard + speculative this lap, do NOT
  re-attempt lightly.** The Reaches claim does NOT close under the WF IH: the successor-exponent case
  (`fs α = inl (some α')`) reduces, after the `omega_pow_succ` limit step + coeff chain, to
  `Reaches x (oadd α' 1 0) (osucc α')` — i.e. "ω^{α'} reaches `osucc α'`", a *different* shape than the
  IH `ω^{α'}` reaches `α'`; and the fixed budget `x` likely must grow along the descent. No identified
  gated-side consumer needs this specific bound (the read-off↔Wainer bridge is already served by the
  banked `hardy_le_fastGrowing` + `hardy_omega_pow_lt_fastGrowing`). native_decide can't help (ω-scale
  `fastGrowing` values blow up the evaluator — confirmed).
- E–W Lemma 19/20 (`N(α) ≤ f^{F^α(0)}(0)`; nested-iterate flattening) — live on the paper's
  operator-controlled `F`/`f` substrate = the gated `Zeh` calculus, NOT a pure mathlib-Hardy fact.

Next substantive move is the judge ratifying `REBUILD-Z-LAP1-VERDICT.md`, then ORDER lap 2.

## Lap 179 — P1 CRUX ADVANCE: the E–W Lemma 19 upper bound is CLOSED and BANKED in `src/`

The sole remaining sorry of the P1 fast-growing-domination bridge —
`hardy_omega_pow_coeff_comp` (the equal-exponent additive composition
`H_{ω^β·(k+2)}(n) = H_{ω^β·(k+1)}(H_{ω^β}(n))`) — is **proven** and the whole bridge is now
sorry-free and kernel-clean (`[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`).

**The key finding: the "sole remaining open obligation" was already 90% in the repo.** Hardy.lean
already carried `hardy_oadd_coeff_step` (`:1536`) — literally `hardy_omega_pow_coeff_comp` verbatim
except for a `β ≠ 0` hypothesis, proven via the banked non-absorbing additive law `hardy_oadd_tail`.
The lap-178 baton didn't spot it (it planned a fresh non-absorbing LIMIT fs-homomorphism proof). The
only genuine gap was the `β = 0` (finite) case, which is one `omega` after rewriting
`oadd 0 m.succPNat 0 = ofNat (m+1)` and `H_{ofNat c}(x) = x + c` (`hardy_ofNat`). So
`hardy_omega_pow_coeff_comp` = `rcases β=0`: finite arm (`ofNat_succ` + `hardy_ofNat` + `omega`) /
`β≠0` arm (`hardy_oadd_coeff_step`). Done.

**Relocated to `src/GoodsteinPA/Hardy.lean`** (before the `end`, as the new "B4 at an arbitrary
transfinite exponent" section — the natural generalization of the finite/successor
`hardy_omega_pow_ofNat`/`_omega` already there). The four now-sorry-free lemmas + `native_decide`
anchors, migrated verbatim; `wip/HardyFastGrowingBridge.lean` deleted (fully subsumed). Full repo
build green (1333 jobs), headline audit surfaces unchanged (`peano_not_proves_goodstein` still
`[propext, choice, goodstein_implies_consistency, Quot.sound]`, sorryAx off, no drift).

Banked in `src/` (all `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`):
- `hardy_omega_pow_coeff_comp` — equal-exponent additive composition, unconditional in `β`.
- `hardy_omega_pow_coeff_le` — the Cichoń–Wainer coefficient intermediate `H_{ω^β·(m+1)}(n)+1 ≤ f_β^[m+1](n+1)`.
- `hardy_omega_pow_add_one_le` — **the E–W Lemma 19 upper bound `H_{ω^α}(n)+1 ≤ f_α(n+1)`,
  UNCONDITIONAL over every `α : ONote`** (WF recursion; base=equality, successor=coeff intermediate,
  limit=IH + fastGrowing index-monotonicity).
- `hardy_omega_pow_lt_fastGrowing` — the strict corollary `H_{ω^α}(n) < f_α(n+1)` P1 consumes.

**What this means for P1.** The raised-control obligation (P1) reduces to `fastGrowing α'(n+1) ≤
(iterate of the input slot)` via `hardy_omega_pow_lt_fastGrowing`: the raised control
`≈ hardy(ω^{α'})` (absorbing regime, lap 178) is now KERNEL-dominated by `f_{α'}` at the shifted
argument. The Lemma-19 *upper* half is banked; the residual is the *iterate-domination* half
`f_{α'}(n+1) ≤ f^{[iterate]}(n+1)` (pin-3's essential iterate index) — the calculus-side work that
stays **judge-gated** behind the lap-1 verdict. Do NOT wire this into pin-3 / `cutElimPass_Zf`
until the judge ratifies (that is reduction discharge, forbidden in Scope-A).

## Lap 178 — CRUX PROBE: additive-identity shortcut to P1 kernel-REFUTED (absorption wall)

Under sustained governor push (cap-bounded, still awaiting judge), attacked the hardest open
calculus obligation directly rather than idle: the P1 raised-control conjunct
`NormControlled f' (raise e α') m` with `raise e α' = e + ω^{α'}`.  Tested the tempting shortcut —
the classical additive Hardy identity `H_{e+β} = H_e ∘ H_β` would make `f' = hardy e ∘ hardy(ω^{α'})`
a concrete E–W iterate, collapsing pin-3's existential iterate (judge Q2).

**KERNEL-VERIFIED (`wip/HardyAddProbe.lean`, sorry-free, build untouched at 1333):** the shortcut is
DEAD. The unconditional identity is FALSE under absorption — `1 + ω = ω` (`rfl`),
`fundamentalSequence (1+ω) = fundamentalSequence ω` (`rfl`), so `H_{1+ω} = H_ω ≠ H_1 ∘ H_ω`. Only the
successor/finite fragment survives (proved the unconditional successor fs homomorphism
`fundamentalSequence_add_succ`, generalizing the banked finite `hardy_add_ofNat`, `Hardy.lean:1257`).
The cut-elimination `raise` grows `ω^{α'}` INTO the absorbing regime, so:

- **P1 is NOT an algebraic identity in `hardy e`** — it is the genuine fast-growing domination
  `hardy(ω^{α'}) ≤ (iterate of the input slot)` (E–W Lemma 19). Pin-3's iterate index is *essential*
  (kills the "collapse `f'` to a composition" idea), corroborates the BW87 cut-free fallback, and
  favors the per-instance headline locus for the P1 conjunct (judge Q1).
- This SHARPENS lap-177's assertion "no option-independent pass infra exists": lap 177 argued the
  E–W norm bound can't be *stated* without forbidden machinery; lap 178 shows the one algebraic
  shortcut that WOULD sidestep it is kernel-false. Full detail:
  `REBUILD-Z-LAP178-FINDING-2026-07-02-additive-identity-absorption-wall.md`.

**Next attack — a PERMITTED, stable-def path REOPENED (corrects lap-177).** Lap 177 said the fast-
growing side "needs the fast-growing `F` + iterate `f^k` machinery = FORBIDDEN cut-elim work." That
premise is WRONG: `ONote.fastGrowing` is a mathlib def with full repo growth theory (`Hardy.lean`
§Basic), and `f^k` is `Function.iterate`. So E–W Lemma 19 is stateable with existing stable-def
machinery. Kernel work this lap (`wip/HardyFastGrowingBridge.lean`):
- The repo's B4 identity `H_{ω^α}=f_α` is kernel-FALSE, off by TWO shifts: (1) `H_{ω^1}(3)=7≠6`, so
  the shifted `=` is `hardy(oadd α 1 0) n + 1 = fastGrowing α (n+1)` (`native_decide` α∈{0,1,2}); (2)
  even THAT `=` holds only at successor/finite exponents — at LIMIT exponents it degrades to STRICT
  `<` (fund-seq index `f n` vs `f(n+1)`, fastGrowing strictly ordinal-monotone). So the UNCONDITIONAL,
  load-bearing truth is the INEQUALITY `hardy(oadd α 1 0) n + 1 ≤ fastGrowing α (n+1)`.
- Target `hardy_omega_pow_add_one_le` (the `≤` form): **base α=0, LIMIT, AND the SUCCESSOR case all
  proven** — the successor case is now WIRED to the coefficient intermediate
  `hardy_omega_pow_coeff_le` (`hardy(oadd β (m+1) 0) n + 1 ≤ fastGrowing β^[m+1](n+1)`, parametrized
  by the outer IH at β), whose **base case (m=0) is proven**. Corollary
  `hardy_omega_pow_lt_fastGrowing` (`hardy(ω^{α'}) n < fastGrowing α'(n+1)`) derived.
- **The coefficient-induction step is now PROVEN modulo one composition identity.** The step
  `H_{ω^β·(m+2)}(n)+1 ≤ f_β^[m+2](n+1)` closes via: composition + the IH at `m` + iterate-
  monotonicity (`fastGrowing_monotone`, `Function.iterate_succ_apply`) + `hbase`. So **the ENTIRE B4
  bridge now reduces to a SINGLE sorry** — the composition lemma
  `hardy_omega_pow_coeff_comp`:  `H_{ω^β·(k+2)}(n) = H_{ω^β·(k+1)}(H_{ω^β}(n))`  (kernel-verified
  β∈{0,1,2}). This is the non-absorbing additive identity `H_{γ+ω^β}=H_γ∘H_{ω^β}` at `γ=ω^β·(k+1)`
  (equal leading exponents `β` ⟹ NO absorption — the benign case, contrast `HardyAddProbe`'s
  absorbing refutation).
- **Immediate next step (permitted):** prove `hardy_omega_pow_coeff_comp` — i.e. the non-absorbing
  LIMIT fs-homomorphism `fundamentalSequence (γ + δ) = (γ + ·)∘fs δ` (when δ's lead exp ≤ γ's trailing
  exp), the branch `HardyAddProbe.lean` proved only for successors (`fundamentalSequence_add_succ`).
  Discharging it collapses the whole B4 bridge → `hardy_omega_pow_lt_fastGrowing` → the P1
  raised-control upper bound. All in `wip/HardyFastGrowingBridge.lean` (out of build target).
- **This reduces P1's raised-control domination to E–W Lemma 19 in the form
  `fastGrowing α' (n+1) ≤ (iterate of input slot)`** — a fast-growing bound on STABLE defs, NOT the
  Zeh calculus. The `≤` bridge is grindable NOW as B4 (permitted, calculus-independent growth
  theory); Lemma 19 + wiring into pin-3 stay judge-gated.

**Immediate next step (permitted):** close the successor case of `hardy_omega_pow_add_one_le` via the
coefficient intermediate `H_{ω^β·(m+1)}` (induction on `m`; the `ω^β·(m+1)` fund-seq is the
`reaches_coeff_step'` territory in `Hardy.lean`). Resume of the GATED work = judge ratification
(Option A/B; pin `f'`); do NOT grind the gated pins.

## Lap 177 — FRESH-MIND REVIEW: state confirmed, no trigger fired, awaiting judge (no in-scope grind)

Independent re-audit (real `#print axioms`, build 🟢 1327) reproduces lap-176 with **no drift**:
Route A headline `[propext, choice, Quot.sound, goodstein_implies_consistency]`, Route B headline
trust-base + `wainer_bound_of_pa_proves_goodstein` + 12 native_decide artifacts — **sorryAx OFF both
headlines**; `OperatorZeh` clean except the 3 §5 pins (`cutReduceAllAuxRunning_Zf`/`stepAllω_Zf`/
`cutElimPass_Zf`) + `probe_cut_all_arm_Zf` (sole sorry-dep = the reduction pin).

**Trigger T-R NOT fired.** Both Z1 seams re-checked axiom-clean in the f-form
(`seam1_bump_absorbed_by_composition` = no axioms; `probe_allomega_reassembly_Zf` =
`[propext,choice,Quot.sound]`), so the E–W carrier composes at both seams — this is NOT the A2
"seam re-check fails in f-form → self-stop" case. The lap-176 P1 finding is **judge-input on
statement shape** (Option A kernel-forced + validated), not a carrier failure.

**No in-scope grind exists.** Scope-A (A1/A2/A3) is complete; the only open sorry *bodies* are the 3
judge-gated §5 pins + the FORBIDDEN Route-A machinery; the non-forbidden Wainer infra
(`Hardy.lean`/`Domination.lean`) is sorry-free. No in-flight Aristotle job; no pending
`ON-LINE-REQUEST`. ALLOW_STOP=1 but the project is far from complete (2 undischarged 🟠 girder
axioms + 19 src sorries) → stop sentinel NOT written; run is cap-bounded. **Resume = judge
ratification of the verdict + finding (Option A vs B; pin `f'`).** Refreshed STATUS.md to the spine.

**A3 completeness VERIFIED (lap 177, not asserted — don't re-check on resume).** Compared the banked
`Zekd` inversion suite against the ported `Zeh` set directly: `OperatorZinfty.lean` has exactly four
invertible-rule theorems — `orInv`:221, `andInvL`:326, `andInvR`:404, `allInv`:484 (plus their
`Zekd`-wrapper ∃-K forms at :2187/2194/2201/2209) — and all four are ported to `Zeh`
(`orInv_Zeh`:842, `andInvL_Zeh`:892, `andInvR_Zeh`:939, `allInv_Zeh`:513, + helper push/pull lemmas).
There is **no `exInv`/`negInv`/`impInv`** in either calculus because ∃ (bounded-witness `exI`), ¬,
and atoms are not invertible rules. So the companion inversion set is genuinely closed — A3 has no
missing safe-grind target. This is the one place "Scope-A exhausted" could have been wrong; it is not.

**No option-independent "pass infrastructure" exists either (lap 177, evidence-backed).** The tempting
"build the E-W Lemma-19 norm bound `N(α) ≤ f^{F^α(0)}(0)` now, since pin 3 needs it under both options"
is doubly blocked: (a) the substrate has `norm` (`Hardy.lean:635` = E-W `N`) but **no fast-growing `F`
and no iterate `f^k`**, so stating Lemma 19 requires DEFINING new machinery = the "cut-elimination …
FORBIDDEN until the judge ratifies" work; (b) pin 3 (`OperatorZeh.lean:700-701`) leaves the iterate
**existential**, and whether to pin it is exactly the Q2 judge decision — so the shape is gated too.
Lap 176 asserted this ("Q2-shape-dependent, hold"); lap 177 verified it with file/line evidence.
**Conclusion: every remaining path requires grinding a gated/forbidden sorry, defining forbidden
cut-elim machinery, or pre-empting the judge. Genuinely nothing permitted remains until the gate opens.**

**Banked one permitted sibling lemma (lap 177): `normControlled_exists_trivial`** (`OperatorZeh.lean`,
axiom-clean `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`) — `∃ f, NormControlled f e m` for any `e, m`, the
kernel backing for the finding's Q2 (`cutElimPass_Zf`'s `∃ f'` slot is vacuous → `f'` must be pinned
to the E-W iterate, not existential). Same permitted category as lap-176's `NormControlled.comp`:
fact about the stable `NormControlled` def, consumes no f-slot pin, touches no gated body, rules on
no judge question. **⚠️ BUILD GOTCHA (verified lap 177):** `OperatorZeh` is in the `GoodsteinPABlueprint`
lib, NOT the `GoodsteinPA` root — `lake build GoodsteinPA` will NOT recompile it (leaves a stale olean).
Use bare **`lake build`** (defaultTargets = both libs) or `lake build GoodsteinPA.OperatorZeh` when
editing this module, else `#print axioms` reads a stale olean.

## Lap 176 — ⭐⭐⭐ CRUX FINDING: the P1 obstruction is a statement-shape artifact (E-W Lemma 25/30 conflation)

**Source cross-check (`papers/eguchi-weiermann-2012-…md`, Def 23 + Lemmas 24–31) of the three
NOT-LOCKED §5 pins.**  Full writeup: `REBUILD-Z-LAP1-FINDING-2026-07-02-fslot-control-raise.md`
(read alongside the verdict before the judge opens the gate).  Kernel-checked facts used:
`raise e α = e + ω^α` (line 58); `raise (ofNat 5) 1 = ω`, `hardy ω 0 = 1 < hardy 5 0 = 5` (line 216).

**The finding.**  Pins 1–2 (`cutReduceAllAuxRunning_Zf`:659, `stepAllω_Zf`:674) pair a
control-RAISE (`raise e α` / `raise E δ` — E-W's **Lemma 30 collapse** move) with numeric
COMPOSITION (`f∘g` — E-W's **Lemma 25 cut-reduction** move).  No single E-W lemma does both: Lemma
25 keeps the control FIXED and composes; Lemma 30 RAISES and ITERATES (`f ↦ f^{F^α(0)+1}`).  Pin 3
(`cutElimPass_Zf`:690) correctly pairs raise with iteration (`f'`, ∃) — it is fine.

**Why it matters (this IS the crux).**  The verdict's #1 judge-question and the "P1
hardy-domination-under-raise, false unconditionally per K2b" obstruction unfold to
`∀x, hardy (raise e α)(max m x) ≤ (f∘g) x` — asking COMPOSITION to dominate the faster-growing
RAISED Hardy target.  That is a category error: dominating a raised control is what ITERATION buys
(Lemma 30 / the Lemma 19 norm bound `N(α) ≤ f^{F^α(0)}(0)`), not composition.  **The P1 wall is an
artifact of gluing Lemma 30's raise onto Lemma 25's numeric update.**

**The fix (judge-owned statement amendment; RECOMMENDED = Option A).**  Confine ALL control-raise +
numeric-iteration to `cutElimPass_Zf` (pin 3, faithful Lemma 30).  Restate the reduction/step
conjuncts at FIXED control: `cutReduceAllAuxRunning_Zf` / `stepAllω_Zf` output at `e`/`E` with
`NormControlled (f∘g) e m` — composition dominating the SAME-control Hardy, provable from input
domination via `NormControlled.mono` + banked `seam1_bump_absorbed_by_composition`, NOT subject to
the K2b raise pathology.  Consequence: **P1 dissolves from the reduction** and the R3 "once per
pass" tension (pins 1–2 raise per-step, but no `mono_e` to unify — a re-entry of the W4B
per-branch-raise-then-unify death) evaporates too.  Option B (raise stays at reduction) forces the
numeric slot to iteration → the "reduction" becomes a collapse → reject unless K1 info-free
membership provably blocks the E-W fixed-`F` "run-at-`F[K]`-then-absorb" step (the ~20% escape).

**Companion finding (kernel-checked this lap): pin 3's existential `f'` is VACUOUS.**
`∃ f', NormControlled f' e' m` is trivially true for any `e', m`
(`⟨fun x => hardy e' (max m x), fun x => le_rfl⟩`, sorry-free), and since `ZehProv` is f-free, `f'`
is decoupled from the derivation.  So `cutElimPass_Zf`'s numeric conjunct adds NO quantitative
content — stronger than verdict Q2's "abstraction choice" framing: it is vacuous and
**read-off-breaking** (E-W Lemma 31's `witness ≤ f(0)` needs the concrete iterate `f`).  Fix: `f'`
MUST be pinned to the E-W iterate of the INPUT `f` (`f' = f^{…}`, Lemma 30), which is exactly where
Option A relocates the real P1 work and where Lemma 19 (`N(α) ≤ f^{F^α(0)}(0)`) makes it achievable.
(Pins 1–2 are NOT vacuous — their `f, g` are explicit params, `f∘g` determined.)

**Option A is now KERNEL-FORCED (the ~20% Option-B escape is closed):** a reduction concluding at
`raise e α` from premises at `e` would have to re-establish every `exI` bound `n ≤ hardy e m` at
`n ≤ hardy (raise e α) m`, but `mono_e_membership_gate_refuted` (`OperatorZeh.lean:224`) proves that
is impossible (`hardy (raise e α)` can be strictly smaller — `hardy ω 0 = 1 < 5`; no `mono_e`).  So
pins 1–2's `raise e α` output is not merely unfaithful — it is UNSOUND as a reduction.  The pass
(pin 3) may raise only because it CONSTRUCTS at the raised control with a fast-growing ITERATE `f'`
that pays the new bounds (E-W Lemma 30) — which is exactly why `f'` must be pinned, not existential.

**Option A also VALIDATED in-kernel (the fix works):** the fixed-control reduction conjunct
`NormControlled (f∘g) e m` is discharged by the new banked lemma `NormControlled.comp`
(`OperatorZeh.lean`, §5; `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`): `NormControlled g e m → (∀y, y ≤ f y) →
NormControlled (f∘g) e m`.  The inflationary hypothesis `∀y, y ≤ f y` is exactly E-W's `(f.1)`
(`2y+1 ≤ f y`).  So under Option A the reduction's numeric obligation is a one-liner from banked
plumbing — confirming P1 was mis-located, not hard.

**Next (still judge-gated — do NOT grind pins pre-ratification):** judge rules Option A vs B AND
whether to pin `f'`.  If A + pin: (1) lap-2's reduction conjunct is `NormControlled.comp` applied
(near-immediate, plumbing banked); (2) the real threading work is the pinned-iterate
`NormControlled (f^{…}) (raise e α') m` at `cutElimPass_Zf`, discharged via the Lemma-19 norm bound.

**NO ELIGIBLE ALTERNATIVE SORRY EXISTS (lap 176 empirical check, don't re-investigate).**  The
"pick another open sorry when blocked" fallback has no valid target here: the only open sorry
*bodies* in `src/` are (a) the 3 gated Scope-A §5 pins (`OperatorZeh`, judge-gated) and (b) the
FORBIDDEN Route-A machinery (`Crux2Blueprint`/`DescentSemantic`, per DIRECTION.md).  The
non-forbidden Wainer-mainline growth infrastructure — `Hardy.lean`, `Domination.lean` — is
**sorry-FREE** (every "sorry" in them is a docstring, e.g. "PROVED, `#print axioms` clean").  So a
resumed lap that finds Scope-A exhausted genuinely has nothing eligible to grind; ending is the only
faithful action (per operator instruction + `box done` bounded-subset guidance).

**SAFE CRUX SURFACE EXHAUSTED for this gate (lap 176 checked, don't re-derive on resume).**  The
finding is complete + kernel-decisive (Option A forced, validated, localized; all 3 verdict
judge-questions answered).  Every remaining crux thread now crosses the gate or builds against the
proven-mis-stated / judge-un-ruled §5 shape: (i) amending pins to Option A = statement change on a
draft already submitted to the judge (desyncs the verdict; hold); (ii) the pass's E-W iteration
machinery (`f^α` Def 16 + Lemma 19) = the gated cut-elimination hard content, and Q2-shape-dependent
(hold); (iii) discharging any pin = judge-gated/FORBIDDEN.  Aristotle: reachable but no in-scope open
target (exit is proven+locked; pins are gated).  Resume = judge ratification of verdict + finding.

## Lap 175 — ⭐⭐⭐ REBUILD-Z lap 1 (Scope-A) done; crux = the f-slot reduction, JUDGE-GATED

**Module: `src/GoodsteinPA/OperatorZeh.lean` (green, 1333 jobs).**  Open obligations here are
exactly the **three §5 f-slot statement pins** (the only `sorry`s in the module):

| pin | what | discharging lap |
|-----|------|-----------------|
| `cutReduceAllAuxRunning_Zf` | running-family §19.6 reduction; output `f∘g` at `raise e α` | 2–4 **(CRUX)** |
| `stepAllω_Zf` | common-control (A2) principal ∀/∃ step | 5–7 |
| `cutElimPass_Zf` | one rank-lowering pass `c+1→c`, f-slot iterated | 5–7 |

**CRITICAL-PATH CRUX = `cutReduceAllAuxRunning_Zf`.**  It is **genuinely blocked, and the
block is a GOVERNANCE gate, not hardness**: `DIRECTION.md` CURRENT DIRECTIVE + `REBUILD-Z-ORDER`
Scope-A mark reduction discharge "**FORBIDDEN until the judge ratifies**
`REBUILD-Z-LAP1-VERDICT.md`" (written THIS lap; no ratification yet).  So it may NOT be attacked
until the judge passes.  Do not grind it pre-ratification.

Three attack paths (for the discharging lap, once the gate opens):
1. **Port the W4B running-family reduction body** onto the `Zeh` core using the now-PROVEN
   `allInv_Zeh` (§4) for the ∀-side handoff (the arm `probe_cut_all_arm_Zf` already type-checks
   the handoff).  The membership/ordinal side is closure-derived; the open piece is the
   `NormControlled (f∘g) (raise e α) m` conjunct = **P1 hardy-domination-under-raise**.
2. **BW87 cut-free fallback (pre-validated):** if P1 threading is kernel-refuted, DON'T thread —
   eliminate cuts (ordinal may tower) and read off the cut-free derivation with the PROVEN
   `readoff_sigma1`.  The cut-free output must still be a legal `Zeh` derivation.
3. **Per-instance domination at the headline** (`e` concrete there): discharge P1 as an instance
   fact, moving the conjunct off the reduction statement onto the headline exit (verdict
   judge-question #1).

**Permitted sibling work while the crux is gated** (infrastructure the assembly reuses, NOT
consuming the f-slots — ALL built this lap, axiom-clean): `allInv_Zeh` +
`orInv_Zeh`/`andInvL_Zeh`/`andInvR_Zeh` (§4/§7); `Zeh.mono_c` rank-monotonicity (§8);
`NormControlled.mono`/`.stage_antitone`/`rel1_mono` (slot/stage domination);
`osucc_add_NF`/`osucc_add_lt_osucc_add`/`add_lt_osucc_add`/`osucc_add_mem` (splice descent);
`add_le_add_NF`/`osucc_le_osucc` (ordinal ≤-bricks); the COMPLETE `ZehProv` rule API
`ZehProv.cut`/`.exI`/`.allω` (each calculus rule packaged at the wrapper level, output
ordinals determined, no rank/control change — the assembly reuses them to introduce and
reassemble) plus `.of`/`.mono`/`.weakening`; `two_level_config_Zeh` (seam-2 non-vacuity
witness); `Zeh.mono_H`, read-off exit (§2/§3).  **The safe pre-build surface is now
EXHAUSTED**: the only un-built
obligations are (i) the gated reduction/step/pass bodies (FORBIDDEN pre-ratification) and
(ii) the P1 `hardy (raise e α)`-domination facts — which must NOT be pre-built, because the
natural domination is FALSE unconditionally (K2b: `raise` can DECREASE `hardy`, e.g.
`hardy ω 0 = 1 < 5`), so its true form is per-instance/stage-conditional and depends on the
§5 statement shape the judge may revise (verdict questions #1–#3).  A resumed pre-ratification
lap should hold — building speculative P1 lemmas against a movable statement is motion, not
progress.

## Lap 169 — ⭐⭐⭐ M2 probe: induction-shell STRUCTURE composes (compiler-verified), but the STEP premise exposes a Z-calculus expressiveness GAP

**On-directive (lap-167 M2 feasibility probe, laps 167–171, HARD GATE 171).** Build 🟢 1326;
`wip/M2Probe.lean` typechecks 0 `sorry`; three new theorems `#print axioms` = `[propext, choice,
Quot.sound]` (clean). HEAD after the lap-169 commit.

This lap made the lap-168 finding-A claim ("the two-sided induction shell is bounded — every rule
needed is present") CONCRETE and, in doing so, REFUTED its optimism at the step premise.

### What compiler-verified this lap (`wip/M2Probe.lean`)
- `zDerivation_of_zIall_R` — the `∀`-peel carries all three `ZDerivesEmptyR` invariants (mirror of
  commit-6's native-Ind carrier). BOUNDED ✓.
- `zDerivation_of_zAx1_R` — the identity-axiom leaf (`C = seqSucc s ∈ seqAnt s`) with invariants;
  discharges the induction BASE premise `Γ → φ(0)` since `φ(0) ∈ Γ`. ✓.
- `twoSidedInductionShell_R` — the full shell `zIall s a p (zInd q at' p d0 d1)` COMPOSES with
  invariants GIVEN the two premise derivations `d0`(base)/`d1`(step). So the STRUCTURE is bounded, no
  invariant explosion — the entire risk collapses onto the two premise hypotheses.
- `PAInductionStepObligation Γ φ b` — the isolated step obligation `Γ, φ(b) → φ(b+1)`.

### 🚨 The isolated obstruction (decision-relevant for the lap-171 gate)
The STEP premise `Γ, φ(b) → φ(b+1)` (from `B = ∀x(φ(x)→φ(x+1)) ∈ Γ` and `φ(b) ∈ Γ`, at the free
eigenvariable `b`) is **NOT closable by internal Z's listed rules**, on TWO independent counts:
1. **No free-variable `∀`-left.** Z's only `∀`-left is `zAxAll`, succedent `substs1 (numeral k) p`
   (`zAxAllSuccWff`, `InternalZ.lean:1576`) — instantiation at a NUMERAL only, never at `qqFvar b`.
2. **No general `∨`-/`→`-left.** Even granting the instance `φ(b)→φ(b+1) = ∼φ(b) ^⋎ φ(b+1)`
   (`Bootstrapping.imp`), that is a general disjunction, NOT the `_ ^⋎ ^⊥` shape `zIneg`/`zAxNeg`
   handle. None of Z's nine `ZPhi` constructors (`InternalZ.lean:5512`) is `∨`-left or `→`-left.

This is exactly the **finitary-`zInd` vs `PA_∞`-ω-rule design fork**: a genuine PA_∞ derives the
induction axiom via NUMERAL instances only (matching `zAxAll`) + the ω-rule; the current finitary
`zInd` (eigenvariable) needs a free-variable `∀`-left that is absent. **Leans PIVOT-B for the
induction leaf as the calculus stands** — CONTRADICTS lap-168's "M2-PLAUSIBLE for step 4."

### For the lap-171 review — re-weigh with THIS signal
Lap-168's optimism ("every rule present") did not survive making the shell concrete. The induction
leaf's STRUCTURE is bounded, but simulating the closed PA induction AXIOM as a standalone Z sequent
hits a real expressiveness gap. Two escape hypotheses to test before verdict (either would reopen
M2-PLAUSIBLE): (α) an admissible free-variable `∀`-left / substitution lemma converting a
numeral-instantiated derivation family into a free-var one; (β) whether the M2 bridge can avoid
deriving the closed axiom standalone (translate the axiom's USE-in-proof, not the leaf in isolation) —
but Foundation's Hilbert-style `axm` leaf enters as a closed formula, so the standalone sequent looks
required. If neither escape lands quickly, the verdict is PIVOT-B.

## Lap 168 — ⭐⭐ `residual` DECOMPOSED into 4 named escapes; C-exit "pure weakening" plan REFUTED

**Build 🟢 1326 (headline root) / 1266 (Crux2Blueprint). HEAD after the lap-168 commit.** Two advances,
both on the live crux-2 `residual` (`genReduct_chain_noRedex_anySucc`, `Crux2Blueprint.lean:~4515`):

### 1. Decomposition (banked)
The single `residual : GenReductCert (zK s r ds) := sorry` is split into the **4 named sub-sorries** that
`_core` (`:4276`) actually dispatches — src crux-2 sorry count rises 1→4 by design (tractable-izes the wall):
- `cExitReplayAll` (hresidualIall) / `cExitReplayNeg` (hresidualIneg) — **C-exit R-intro replay**: the least
  exit `jstar` node is itself a `zIall`/`zIneg` whose succedent IS the conclusion `C = seqSucc s`. Called
  ONLY on the C-exit branch (`hjstar = Or.inl hC`), so `seqSucc s ≠ ⊥` there (⊥-branch is `absurd` via
  `qqAll_ne_falsum`/`inegF_ne_falsum`). The genuine NEW content of the anySucc generalization.
- `gammaAllCut` (hresidualAll, R2 `^∀G ∈ Γ`) / `gammaNegCut` (hresidualNeg, R1 `inegF q ∈ Γ`) — deep
  Buchholz general-cut leaves; both need a formula in `Γ`, VACUOUS at the headline `∅→⊥`.

### 2. In-kernel REFUTATION of the lap-166 "C-exit = grow the antecedent" plan
Lap-166 PENDING said: close cExitReplay via internal weakening, "`Γ_j ⊆ Γ` via `hthread0`; grow the
antecedent." **This is WRONG.** `hthread0`/`isChainInf` (`InternalZ.lean:1197-1198`) gives
`inAnt B (chainAnt ds i) → inAnt B (seqAnt s) ∨ ∃ i' < i, B = chainAsucc ds i'` — i.e.
`chainAnt ds jstar ⊆ seqAnt s ∪ {chainAsucc ds i' : i' < jstar}`, **NOT** `⊆ seqAnt s`. Those extra
`chainAsucc ds i'` are earlier premises' succedents accumulated by the cut-chain threading; by jstar
minimality they are non-C **and** non-⊥ (`hmin`), so in general NOT in `seqAnt s`. To derive `seqAnt s → C`
from `chainAnt ds jstar → C` those formulas must be **removed** (cut against the earlier premises that
derive them), which is the OPPOSITE of weakening. ⇒ the C-exit reduct is a **cut-restructuring**, not an
antecedent-weakening. Pure weakening only closes the `jstar = 0` sub-case (no earlier premises, `∃ i'<0`
vacuous).

### 🎯 NEXT ATTACK on the C-exit pair — VALIDATED prefix sub-chain reduct (feasibility settled)
Reduct = the **prefix sub-chain** `v := zK s r (ds ↾ under (jstar+1))`. **All feasibility questions from
the lap-168 first pass are now RESOLVED in-kernel:**
- `iRedDescent v (zK s r ds)` requires ONLY `idg v ≤ idg d ∧ icmp (iotil v)(iotil d) = 0 ∧ isNF (iotil v)`
  (`InternalZ.lean:6232`) — **NO rank drop**. The lap-168 worry "the reduction must lower the cut rank"
  was WRONG: the FORMALIZED descent is purely õ/idg. So keeping rank `r` is fine. This overturns the
  STATUS "depth ≈ zAxBot internal weakening" framing — no weakening is needed at all.
- **õ-drop DONE**: `iseqNaddIdgAux_lt_of_lt` (lap-168, `InternalZ.lean` after `:3448`) proves
  `icmp (iseqNaddIdgAux ds (jstar+1)) (iseqNaddIdgAux ds (lh ds)) = 0` when `jstar+1 < lh ds`. Combine
  with `iotil_zK` (`= iseqNaddIdg ds = iseqNaddIdgAux ds (lh ds)`) and `iseqNaddIdgAux_congr_iotil`
  (prefix entries agree with `ds` up to `jstar+1`) to get `icmp (iotil v)(iotil (zK s r ds)) = 0`.
- `idg v ≤ idg d`: `idg_zK = max r (iseqMaxIdg _ - 1)`; prefix's `iseqMaxIdg ≤` full's via
  `iseqMaxIdgAux_mono` (already exists, `:3451`) — max over a sub-fold.
- **prefix `Seq` is nearly free**: `Seq.restr` / `Seq.restr_lh` (Foundation `HFS/Seq.lean:218,221`) give
  `Seq (ds ↾ under (jstar+1))` and `lh = jstar+1` from `jstar+1 ≤ lh ds`. `znth (ds ↾ under i) n = znth ds n`
  for `n < i` via `Seq.znth_eq_of_mem` + `pair_mem_restr_iff` + `mem_under_iff`.

**REMAINING BUILD (mechanical, ~1 lap):** (a) three prefix `znth`/`lh`/`Seq` glue lemmas; (b)
`zKValidF s r (prefix)` — `isChainInf` with distinguished `j0 := jstar` (C-exit `hC`, threading `hthread0`
+ rank `hrank0` restricted to `i ≤ jstar`, all inherited) plus per-premise wff (inherited from full
`hZ`); (c) `ZRegular/ZFresh/ZSeqAnt (zK s r prefix)` from the premise projections; (d) assemble
`certReplace` (`Or.inl`). This closes `cExitReplayAll`/`cExitReplayNeg` for the dominant case
`jstar+1 < lh ds`. Both hooks are structurally identical (zIall vs zIneg) — build one helper
`cExitPrefixReplace` parametric over the R-intro tag.

**EDGE CASE `jstar+1 = lh ds`** (exit R-intro is the LAST premise → prefix = full chain, no õ-drop):
needs cut-permutation (pull the R-intro out below the cut: reduct = R-intro of `C` whose premise is the
rank-`r` cut of the prefix `0..jstar-1` against the R-intro's own sub-derivation `d0`). Separate, smaller
residual — leave as a narrowed sorry after the main case lands. Do NOT re-attempt "grow the antecedent".

---

## Lap 166 — ⭐⭐⭐ STRUCTURAL CORRECTION: the reframe target was ORPHANED; live crux = exactly 2 src sorries

**Build 🟢 1326. HEAD after the lap-166 commits.** Two threads this lap: (1) the named-axiom-blueprint LEDGER
conversion (headline wired through `goodstein_implies_consistency`; see `HANDOFF-2026-06-28-lap166.md`); (2) the
MATH below — a verified structural finding + one real src-sorry DROP.

### The finding (verified by call-graph + a green build, no axiom drift)
`axMajorResidual` and its entire enclosing ⊥-cluster — `genReduct_chain_noRedex` (`:4838`) ← `genReduct_botSucc_chain`
(`:4867`) ← `genReduct_botSucc` (`:4895`) — are **ORPHANED**: nothing in any live proof consumes `genReduct_botSucc`
(its only term-level reference is its own internal recursion). `descent_step_K_noncrit_axMajor` (`:5180`) is a
sorry-free orphan DUPLICATE of the live `descent_step_K_noncrit_recurse`. `ind_reduct_botSucc_of_fresh` (`:2920`) is
consumed only by the orphan `genReduct_botSucc`. **So the lap-164/165 plan — "GLOBAL-THREADING REFRAME through
`genReduct_botSucc` to DROP `axMajorResidual`" — was aimed at DEAD code.**

The **live headline recursion** is the any-succedent generalization:
`ZDerivesEmptyR_descent_step` (`:5260`) → `descent_step_K_majorIdx` → `descent_step_K_noncritical` →
`descent_step_K_noncrit_recurse` (`:5204`) → `genReduct_chain_noRedex_empty` (`:4948`, **sorry-FREE**, discharges
R1/R2 by Γ=∅ vacuity) **with IH `genReduct_anySucc`** (`:4549`) → code-recursion → tag-3 `ind_reduct_anySucc`
(`:3680`) / tag-4 `genReduct_anySucc_chain` → `genReduct_chain_noRedex_anySucc` (`:4504`, the `residual`).

### What landed: `axMajorResidual` DROPPED (`genReduct_chain_noRedex` now sorry-free)
Discharged `have axMajorResidual : GenReductCert (zK s r ds) := sorry` by
`genReduct_anySucc hZ hreg hfresh hseqant (Or.inr (zTag_zK s r ds))` — a {3,4} `Rep` node deriving `Γ→F` for ANY
`F` (here `F=⊥`) has a `GenReductCert`, so the ⊥-succedent wrapper is a special case of the any-succedent reduction.
This REALIZES the subsumption `genReduct_anySucc`'s docstring already claims ("the single key that closes
`axMajorResidual`"); the wiring was never done. Non-circular (`genReduct_anySucc` recurses via the *anySucc* chain,
never back into `genReduct_chain_noRedex`). Verified: src crux-2 engine sorries DROP to **exactly 2**; headline +
`false_of_ZDerivesEmpty_builder` `#print axioms` UNCHANGED (confirms orphan-hood).

### 🎯 THE genuine live crux-2 engine = EXACTLY 2 src sorries (the real next targets)
1. **`residual`** (`:4520` in `genReduct_chain_noRedex_anySucc`). Its `_core` (`:4265`) exposes FOUR escape hooks
   (currently all caught by the single `residual` sorry):
   - `hresidualIall`/`hresidualIneg` — **C-exit R-intro replay**: the chain exit `j` is itself a `zIall`/`zIneg`
     deriving `Γ_j → C` where `C = seqSucc s` is the conclusion succedent. Reduct = re-base that R-intro's own
     sub-derivation to `Γ → C` (drops the cut chain, `õ`-descends). NEEDS an **internal weakening** lemma
     (`Γ_j ⊆ Γ` via `hthread0`; grow the antecedent — cf. `isChainInf_growAnt` `:3878`). Depth ≈ how ⊥-exit
     ex-falso needed the new `zAxBot` constructor. **VACUOUS when `C=⊥`** (no R-intro produces `⊥`) — which is why
     the dropped ⊥-version had no such hook. ⇒ FIRST genuine new piece to build.
   - `hresidualAll` (R2: `^∀G ∈ Γ`) / `hresidualNeg` (R1: `inegF q ∈ Γ`) — genuine Γ-general ∀-cut / cut on `q`.
   Cheap DROP-shaped first step (per DIRECTION.md): split `residual` into these 4 NAMED sub-sorries, then close the
   C-exit pair via the new weakening lemma, leaving R1/R2 as the deep Buchholz general-cut leaves.
2. **`ind_reduct_anySucc`** (`:3680`). General-`C` Ind reduct. The proven ⊥-twin `ind_reduct_botSucc_of_fresh`
   (`:2920`) leans essentially on `p=⊥` (`eq_falsum_of_substs1_falsum`) to make the induction VACUOUS (`k=1` reduct).
   For general `C` the reduct is the lap-136 k-fold `⟨d0, d1[a:=0..k-1]⟩`, `k=⟦t⟧` (the hard sub-problem; the repo
   lacks `inadd_assoc` for general `k`). EASY sub-case: when `substs1 t p = p` (closed `p`, e.g. `C=^∀^k⊥`) the
   reduct is just `d0` (a `certReplace`). Worth checking whether the recursion only feeds closed-`p` Ind nodes.

### Cleanup (optional, non-urgent): the orphan ⊥-cluster
`genReduct_botSucc`, `genReduct_botSucc_chain`, `genReduct_chain_noRedex`, `descent_step_K_noncrit_axMajor`,
`ind_reduct_botSucc_of_fresh` are now all sorry-free dead code (superseded by the anySucc generalization). Park in
`wip/` or delete to de-clutter the live path — left in place this lap (non-destructive; build-verified dead).

## Lap 165 (M1b-term) — ⭐⭐⭐ KEYSTONE `closeNonRepProducer` PROVEN + WIRED; both residuals narrowed to R1/R2

**Build 🟢 1326. HEAD `6732eb2` (3 commits `9a3d78e`,`5f03aee`,`6732eb2`).** No src sorry dropped (still 46),
but the keystone least-number RECURSION the lap-164 handoff named is now **in-kernel and sorry-free**, and
BOTH `residual`/`axMajorResidual` copies are reduced to exactly two sharply-characterized escapes. Real
`#print axioms`: `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` + headline = `[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math
axioms, no drift); **`closeNonRepProducer` = `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]` (sorry-FREE)**.

### What landed
1. **`climb_to_rep_producer` exposes `m < jstar`** (was `m ≤ j0`; `InternalZ.lean`). The least ∀-producer
   `m₀ ≤ n₀ < jstar`, now in the signature — the prerequisite that lets the recursion's `n*`-leastness
   rule out the climb's `{6,8}` landings.
2. **`closeNonRepProducer` (top-level lemma, `Crux2Blueprint.lean` ~:3382, `set_option maxHeartbeats
   1600000`).** Given the no-redex chain data + the per-case closers (`hrepClose`/`hleafClose`/`haxNegClose`/
   `hcollapse`) + a residual cert `hresidual`, ANY L-axiom producer (tag∈{5,6,8})≤j0 yields
   `GenReductCert (zK s r ds)` via a GLOBAL `least_number` over `{5,6,8}`-producers ≤ j0: the least `n*`'s
   active formula threads (`collapse`/∀-`climb`) to `m' < n*`, which `n*`-leastness forces into `{3,4}`
   (→`hrepClose`) or a right-symbol R-intro forming an `isRedexPair` with `n*` (→`hnolow`, ⊥). **Proven
   sorry-free** (uses the passed `hresidual`, not a `sorry`).
3. **Wired into BOTH copies** via a local `cnrp` wrapper: `closeZAxNeg` is a thin wrapper, `tryProducerClose`
   tag-5/6/8 → `cnrp`, and the main tag-6 jstar block collapses to one `cnrp jstar` call. Net **−134 lines**
   (the unified closer subsumes the duplicated per-tag dispatch).

### 🎯 The genuine remaining open core (sharply pinned)
After wiring, `axMajorResidual` / `residual` are reached ONLY from:
- **(R1)** tag-6 producer with `inegF q ∈ Γ` whose POSITIVE `q` is produced by an R-intro (`n*` left-consumes
  `inegF q`, NOT `q`, so no redex). Reduct = a genuine cut on `q` (`irk q ≤ r`).
- **(R2)** tag-5 ∀-climb landing `^∀G ∈ Γ`. Reduct = a genuine ∀-cut on `^∀G` (instantiating gives only
  `G`'s instance, not the exit succedent).
- **(anySucc only)** the main tag-5 jstar escape `^∀p' ∈ Γ` (an R2-twin) + the **Family-C** C-exit R-intro
  replay (tag-1/2 jstar producing the conclusion `C`; needs internal weakening / chain-truncation).
- The ⊥-version `axMajorResidual` is now **PURELY R1/R2** (no C-exit — that is anySucc-only).

**KEY:** R1, R2, and the tag-5 escape ALL require a formula in `Γ = seqAnt s`, hence are **VACUOUS for the
headline `∅→⊥`** (outer Γ=∅). The obstruction to a DROP: `genReduct_chain_noRedex` is Γ-GENERAL — the
recursion (`repProducerClose` → `genReduct_anySucc`/`genReduct_botSucc` code-induction) descends into Rep
producers whose Γ_sub is NON-empty (its formulas thread to earlier outer succedents, not to ∅), so R1/R2 ARE
reachable in the recursion.

### Next attack (ranked) — toward an actual DROP of `axMajorResidual`
- **(a) GLOBAL-THREADING REFRAME (the drop path).** Thread an invariant "every Γ_sub formula traces (via the
  ROOT chain's `hthread0`) to the outer Γ=∅ or an earlier outer succedent" through `genReduct_botSucc`'s
  `zDerivation_sigma_induction`. Then R1's `inegF q ∈ Γ_sub` / R2's `^∀G ∈ Γ_sub` trace to root-∅ →
  vacuous → `closeNonRepProducer`'s `hresidual` is never hit → `axMajorResidual` DROPS. The wall: the
  code-IH does not currently carry the outer threading; this is a structural strengthening of the
  `GenReductCert` motive (carry a "Γ ⊆ {earlier succedents}" predicate). 1-2 lap reframe; the cleanest path
  to the first real drop since the narrowing began.
- **(b) Handle R1/R2 as genuine cut-reductions** (Γ-general). R1 = cut on `q` (`irk q ≤ r`), R2 = ∀-cut on
  `^∀G`. These are the deep Buchholz general-cut pieces; harder than (a). Defer.
- **(c) Family-C C-exit** (anySucc only): tag-1/2 jstar R-intro producing `C` — needs internal weakening
  (re-base the R-intro to conclude the full `Γ→C`); analogous depth to how ex-falso needed `zAxBot`. Defer.

### FORBIDDEN / ALTITUDE (per DIRECTION.md lap-161/164, unchanged)
`red` witnesses; `iord`-recursion for the construction; `redLeast`/μ-min for gDef; the refuted single-premise
`seqUpdate` splice; axMajor/gDef STANDALONE before the port; M2/M3/M4 wiring until `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty`
is sorry-free. **ALTITUDE:** a sorry-free `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` is NOT the headline — `goodstein_implies_
consistency` (`Reduction.lean:68`) is a bare sorry, M2/M4 ~0%.

---

## Lap 164 (FRESH-MIND REVIEW) — direction KEPT; `residual`/`axMajorResidual` NARROWED (tags 0/1/2/7 producers now PHANTOM)

**Build 🟢 1326. HEAD after commit.** Review lap: DIRECTION.md CURRENT DIRECTIVE + STATUS.md refreshed (lap-164
banner), direction KEPT (finish `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty`; ex-falso done lap-163; M2 deferred by design). Real
`#print axioms` re-verified, no drift. Then a verified in-kernel **crux-narrowing** (no sorry dropped, but the
open core SHRANK in both residual copies).

### What landed (the narrowing — `tryProducerClose` strengthened)
`tryProducerClose` (in BOTH `residual` :~3565 anySucc AND `axMajorResidual` :~3885 ⊥-version) now takes 3 extra
hyps `zTag(znth ds m) ≠ 0`, `≠ 7`, `π₁(tp(znth ds m)) ≠ 0` — all supplied by the call sites (the producer `m`
comes from `collapse`, which guarantees NON-LEAF `zTag ≠ 0,7`; the call is in the `else` branch of
`by_cases π₁(tp)=0`, i.e. NON-right-symbol). So **tags 0/1/2/7 are now PHANTOM** (closed in-kernel by `absurd`):
- tag-0 (zAtom)/tag-7 (zAx1): leaves → contradict non-leaf.
- tag-1 (zIall)/tag-2 (zIneg): R-intros (`tp = isymR …`, `π₁ = 0` by `pi₁_isymR`) → contradict non-right-symbol
  (they would form an `isRedexPair` with `jstar`, killed by `hnolow` — the same logic `rightSym_producer_redex`
  already applies one level up). Verified facts: `tp_zIall/zIneg = isymR …`, `π₁(isymR)=0`, `π₁(isymRep)=2`.

### 🎯 Genuine remaining residual core (post-narrowing — the precise next target)
After the narrowing, `axMajorResidual` (⊥) / `residual` (anySucc) are reached ONLY from:
1. **tag-6 partial thread** (`:4018` ⊥ / `:3646` anySucc): `inegF p' ∈ Γ` but `p'` threads to a non-leaf
   producer, not Γ. Also `closeZAxNeg`'s `:3868/:3869` (⊥) / `:3560/:3561` (anySucc) — same `¬q`/`q` no-thread.
2. **tag-8 ⊥-producer** (`tryProducerClose` tag-8, `:3908` ⊥ / `:3590` anySucc; + the tag-5 climb→tag-8 landing):
   a `zAxBot` producer with `⊥ ∈ Γ_m`. Threads (`collapse`) to `⊥ ∈ Γ` (→ `leafClose`/`exFalsoClose`, AVAILABLE
   since lap-163!) OR an earlier non-leaf ⊥-exit `m' < m`. The earlier-⊥-exit case needs `tryProducerClose m'`
   RECURSIVELY → blocked because `tryProducerClose` is a non-recursive `have`. FIX = restructure it as a
   bounded (strong-induction-on-`m`) recursion, or factor a `botThread` helper. **Likely the cheapest real DROP
   next** — it only reuses lap-163 ex-falso + a finite descent on producer index.
3. **tag-5 climb escape** (`:3899/:3904` ⊥ / `:3582`/`:3587` anySucc): `climb_to_rep_producer` ESCAPE disjunct =
   a `^∀`-formula `G ∈ Γ`. Needs a GENERAL ∀-instantiation reduct `^∀G ∈ Γ ⟹ Γ→C` (generalize `axAllClose`,
   which is currently only `^∀⊥ ∈ Γ → Γ→⊥`).
4. **(anySucc only) C-exit R-intro replay** (`:3613`/`:3619`): the least-exit major is itself a tag-1/2 zIall/
   zIneg producing the conclusion succedent `C`. Needs internal WEAKENING / chain-truncation (re-base the
   R-intro to conclude the full `Γ→C`) — the genuine general-cut-elimination piece; analogous in depth to how
   ex-falso needed the new `zAxBot` constructor. NOT a quick win.

### ✅ NARROWING COMPLETE (lap-164, commits 7a999c8..b98a8d8) — the residual is now UNIFORM
All four narrowing rounds landed green (sorry count 46 throughout, no axiom drift):
- **r1** tags 0/1/2/7 producers PHANTOM in `tryProducerClose` (non-leaf + non-right-symbol).
- **r2** tag-8 ⊥-producer `⊥∈Γ` → `leafClose`/`exFalsoClose`.
- **r3** tag-6 partial `p'`-producer: Rep (3,4) → `repProducerClose`.
- **r4** `closeZAxNeg` ¬q/q-producers: Rep (3,4) → `repProducerClose`.
**Net:** EVERY `residual`/`axMajorResidual` landing is now one of: (A) a NON-Rep producer (axiom tag-5/6/8 or
a non-redex R-intro tag-1/2) whose active formula threads to ANOTHER non-Rep producer at a STRICTLY SMALLER
index; or (B) a `^∀Z∈Γ` climb-escape; or (C) [anySucc only] the C-exit R-intro replay. This is the clean,
uniform target the recursive closer needs.

### THE keystone next move — `closeNonRepProducer` (recursive, strong-induction on the producer index)
Build a top-level lemma that closes (A) by **strong induction / least-counterexample on the V-index** of the
producer (every thread step goes to a strictly smaller index, so it is well-founded; motive
`GenReductCert (zK s r ds)` is Σ₁, antecedents Δ₁, so the implication motive is Σ₁ → use `least_number`-style
least counterexample, mirroring the `jstar`-leastness pattern already in these lemmas). Dispatch per producer
tag: Rep(3,4)→`repProducerClose` (base), zAxNeg(6)→thread ¬q/q (recurse on smaller-index producer or close at
Γ via `axNegCloseGen`), zAxAll(5)→`climb_to_rep_producer` (lands {3,4,6,8} or escape), zAxBot(8)→thread ⊥
(recurse or `leafClose` at Γ); R-intro(1,2) phantom by non-right-symbol. Closing (A) leaves ONLY (B) the
`^∀Z∈Γ` escape + (C) the C-exit — both genuine cut-elimination constructions (the ∀-tower elimination
`^∀^{k}⊥∈Γ ⟹ Γ→⊥` needs a cut-tower or a new structural rule, analogous to how ex-falso needed `zAxBot`;
deferred). **Check FIRST:** whether the escape (B) is even reachable when the OUTER Γ=∅ (it is vacuous there)
— if the recursion preserves "escape ⟹ formula was in the outer Γ", (B) may be vacuous for the headline
`∅→⊥` and the whole `axMajorResidual` collapses with just (A).

### Next attack (ranked)
- **(a) tag-8 ⊥-producer (item 2)** — PARTIALLY DONE lap-164: the `⊥∈Γ` sub-case now closes directly via
  `collapse` → `leafClose`/`exFalsoClose` (in both `tryProducerClose` copies). Remaining = the NON-LEAF
  earlier-⊥-exit sub-case (`collapse`'s `Or.inr`: a non-leaf `m' < m` with `chainAsucc m' = ⊥`). m' has tag
  ∈ {3,4,5,6,8} (1,2 phantom: R-intro can't produce ⊥); 3,4 → `repProducerClose m'`, 6 → `closeZAxNeg m'`,
  5 → climb, 8 → recurse. To close it, restructure `tryProducerClose` as a bounded strong-induction-on-`m`
  recursion (the tag-8/climb-tag-8 cases then recurse on the strictly-smaller `m'`); base = the `⊥∈Γ` close
  just wired. Also wire the climb→tag-8 landing (`:3904` ⊥ / `:3587` anySucc) the same way (needs the
  constructor from `h8 : zTag = 8` — use `zDerivation_iff.mp` + tag-8 case, or a `zAxBot_of_tag` helper).
- **(b) general ∀-instantiation `axAllClose` (item 3)** — generalize `^∀⊥∈Γ→Γ→⊥` to `^∀G∈Γ→Γ→C` (the §5
  L∀-axiom `zAxAll s G-matrix …`), closing the tag-5 climb escape in both copies (shared, like `threadEscapeClose`).
- **(c) tag-6 partial (item 1)** — the `p'`-doesn't-thread case; check whether `p'` threading to a non-leaf
  producer is itself reducible (the producer is a `Rep`/¬-axiom by `hnolow`).
- **(d) C-exit R-intro replay (item 4)** — the deep one; defer until (a)-(c) shrink everything else.

## Lap 163 (M1b-term) — ⭐⭐⭐ `zDerivation_zAxBot` DROPPED; ZPhi disjunct #9 (zAxBot, tag-8) FULLY WIRED, axiom-clean

**Build 🟢 1326. HEAD `09cd161`.** ONE src sorry dropped on the M1b-term path (Crux2Blueprint 47→46, zero
added). `zDerivation_zAxBot` = `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` (no sorryAx). `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty`
axioms UNCHANGED `[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]` (no drift).

### What landed
Executed the full ROUTE 2 ripple (the lap-116 `zAx1` precedent, ~150 sites — LARGER than the lap-162
"~125" estimate, which missed the `rcases hphi` ZPhi-induction sites + the substitution machinery +
`zsubstNext`/`maxEigen`/`red` recursion-table dispatchers). Added the 9th `ZPhi` disjunct
`(∃ s, d = zAxBot s ∧ inAnt (^⊥) (seqAnt s))` + `zphi_monotone`/`_strong_finite`/`_iff` + `zblueprint`
Σ/Π + `zPhi_definable` + `zsubstNext`(faithful tag-8 sequent-subst)+arith + `zDerivation_zAxBot_intro`/
`_inv` + `red_zAxBot`/`zsubst_zAxBot`/`maxEigen_zAxBot`/`red_zK_fixpoint_of_zAxBot_selected` + ALL
destructuring/build sites across InternalZ/Zsubst/Crux2Blueprint/RedZKDescent. **`exFalsoClose`
(`:3501`) is now fully real** → the entire ⊥-exit ex-falso is sorry-free.
Non-mechanical sites resolved faithfully: `climb_to_rep_producer` carries tag-8 as a producer tag;
`majorPrem_tag_mem` EXCLUDES a tag-8 ⊥-orbit major via ⊥-rerouting; ex-falso **major** in the dispatch →
`exFalsoClose`/`leafClose`; ex-falso **producer** → `residual`/`axMajorResidual`.

### 🎯 NEXT — close `genReduct_chain_noRedex`'s `residual` (the other two lap-161 escapes)
The ⊥-exit ex-falso is DONE. Remaining in `residual`/`axMajorResidual` (`genReduct_chain_noRedex` anySucc
copy `~:3486`): (i) **C-exit R-intro replay** (tag-1/2 major producing the conclusion `C`, routed to
`residual` at `:3607`/`:3616`); (ii) **tag-5/6 thread-escape** (the `climb` ESCAPE `^∀`-in-Γ + producer
landings). Closing both DROPS `genReduct_chain_noRedex_anySucc` (`~:3430`), consumed by
`axMajorResidual`/`descent_step_K_noncrit_axMajor`. Full detail in `HANDOFF-2026-06-27-lap163.md`.

## Lap 162 (M1b-term, ex-falso ordinal spike) — ⭐ ROUTE 4 REFUTED in-kernel; the directive's ROUTE 2 (`zAxBot`) is REQUIRED

**Build 🟢 (src untouched; spike `wip/ExFalsoOrdinalSpike.lean` compiles, exit 0). `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty`
unchanged = `[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms).** No src sorry dropped this lap — the
deliverable is a DECISIVE design correction that prevents the next several laps from grinding a dead route.

### ⭐⭐⭐ THE FINDING — the lap-161 "ROUTE 4 = pure assembly" mandate is WRONG; ex-falso needs a Z-system extension
`exFalsoClose` (`Crux2Blueprint:3477`) must produce `GenReductCert (zK s r ds)` from `⊥ ∈ seqAnt s` for a
GENERAL succedent `C = seqSucc s`. `GenReductCert` via `certReplace` demands `iRedDescent v (zK s r ds)`, whose
`otil_lt` field is the STRICT drop `icmp (iotil v) (iotil (zK s r ds)) = 0`, and `iotil (zK s r ds) = iseqNaddIdg ds`
(`iotil_zK`). **A degenerate single-leaf ⊥-exit chain (`lh ds = 1`, lone entry an `iotil=0` leaf) has
`iseqNaddIdg ds = ω^0 = 1`** (`iseqNaddIdgAux_succ` over `iseqNaddIdgAux_zero`; spike `leaf_chain_iseqNaddIdg`).
Such a chain IS valid + reachable: a `zK s r [zAtom s']` whose lone leaf derives `Γ'→⊥` with `⊥∈Γ'⊆Γ` exits at
`⊥` and so derives `Γ→C` for ARBITRARY `C` (the ⊥-exit IS the semantic content of `zKValidF`'s `⊥` disjunct).

**Route 4 (formula-structure R-intro tower over `C`) CANNOT drop:** every R-intro raises `iotil` by `+1`
(`iotil_zIall`/`iotil_zIneg = iadd · (ω^0)`), so even the cheapest tower `zIneg s p (zAtom s')` already has
`iotil = ω^0 = 1` (spike `tower_iotil`) — EQUAL to the degenerate chain's `iotil (zK)`, so `icmp = 1 ≠ 0`
(`icmp_self`): `iRedDescent.otil_lt` FAILS. **Proven in-kernel: `wip/ExFalsoOrdinalSpike.lean : tower_no_drop`.**
(General form of the obstruction: an `n`-leaf chain folds to `iseqNaddIdg = n`, while a `^∀^k⊥` tower has
`iotil = k`; `k` (= ∀-depth of the cut formula) is unbounded and independent of `n` (= chain length), so a
`k ≥ n` configuration always exists — the tower generically fails to drop.)

**The descent interface canNOT be weakened to `iord`-level either.** `iord d = iotower (iotil d) (idg d)` is a
height-`idg` tower, so a tag-8 leaf (idg 0, iotil 0) has `iord 0` and WOULD `iord`-drop. BUT the terminal
ex-falso reduct is later SPLICED as a `{3,4}`-producer-premise cert by `certReplace_of_premise_cert`
(`:3317-3318`), which derives the PARENT's strict `iotil` drop from the PER-PREMISE strict `iotil` drop via the
`#`-fold `iseqNaddIdg` (`iotil_iCritAux_lt` = `iseqNaddIdgAux_lt_replace`). An `iord`-only (idg-dropping) premise
does NOT shrink that fold. So the reduct genuinely needs `iotil = 0`, full stop.

**Relaxing `zAtom`'s side condition (the cheap-looking alternative) CORRUPTS the threading invariants.** A zAtom
node deriving `Γ→C` currently GUARANTEES `C ∈ Γ` (`zDerivation_zAtom_inv`), which `leastSucc_in_ant_or_nonleaf`
(`InternalZ:9099`) and `chainAsucc_threaded_of_leaf` (`:9047`) rely on to thread a leaf's succedent. If a zAtom
could fire on `⊥∈Γ` WITHOUT `C∈Γ`, an "ex-falso leaf" has `zTag = 0` yet its succedent doesn't thread → BOTH
disjuncts of `leastSucc_in_ant_or_nonleaf`'s conclusion fail. That lemma is load-bearing in the active crux
(`collapse`). So `zAxBot` must be a NEW tag, not a relaxed `zAtom`.

### ✅ THE FIX — ROUTE 2 (the directive's own fallback): a NEW `iotil = 0` ⊥-left leaf `zAxBot` (tag 8)
Only `iotil = 0` strict-drops below `iseqNaddIdg ds ≠ 0` (`icmp_zero_pos`, the `leafCloseC` move, unconditional
via `hposlast`). The SOLE existing `iotil=0` constructor is `zAtom` (needs `C∈Γ`, not `⊥∈Γ`). So add
`zAxBot s := ⟪s, 8, 0⟫ + 1` with ZPhi disjunct `(∃ s, d = zAxBot s ∧ inAnt (^⊥) (seqAnt s))` deriving `Γ→C`
for ANY `C`. **Proven in-kernel that ANY `iotil=0` leaf closes: `wip/ExFalsoOrdinalSpike.lean : leaf_reduct_drops`.**

**De-risking finding:** the ordinal dispatchers `ioNext` (`InternalZ:2261`, `else 0`) and `idgTable` already
DEFAULT unknown tags to `0`, so a tag-8 `zAxBot` auto-gets `iotil = idg = iord = 0` with **NO dispatcher edits**.
The cost is the ZPhi disjunct + the `zblueprint` Σ/Π pair (`:5559`) + `zphi_iff`/`zphi_monotone`/`zphi_strong_finite`
+ `zPhi_definable` (`:5605`, add a `qqFalsum`/`inAnt` defn clause) + the ~125 `zDerivation_iff.mp` destructuring
sites (each gets a trailing 9th `| ⟨s, h, hbot⟩` branch — mostly trivial, the new leaf behaves like `zAtom`) +
soundness. Precedent: lap-116 added `zAx1` as the 8th disjunct ("64-site ripple") in a focused effort. This is a
2-3 lap structural extension, NOT "pure assembly".

### 🎯 NEXT (route 2, in order) — each step a green checkpoint
1. ✅ **DONE (lap 162, build 🟢 1326).** `zAxBot` constructor + projections (additive). Landed in
   `InternalZ.lean`: `def zAxBot s := ⟪s,8,0⟫+1` + `zAxBotGraph`/`zAxBot_defined`, `seq_lt_zAxBot`,
   `zTag_zAxBot = 8`, `fstIdx_zAxBot = s`, `tp_zAxBot = isymRep`, `idg_zAxBot = 0`, `iotil_zAxBot = 0`,
   `isNF_iotil_zAxBot`, `iord_zAxBot = 0`; in `Zsubst.lean`: `zReg_zAxBot = 0`, `zFresh_zAxBot = 0`,
   `zSeqAnt_zAxBot = seqAntSeqFlag s`. All mirror `zAtom` (dispatchers default tag 8 → 0). `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty`
   axioms unchanged (`[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]`, no drift).
3. ✅ **DONE (lap 162, build 🟢 1326).** `exFalsoClose` (`Crux2Blueprint:3477`) is now a REAL `certReplace`
   cert (no longer a `have`-sorry) — KERNEL-VERIFIED that the 9 step-1 `zAxBot` projection lemmas line up:
   `Or.inl ⟨zAxBot s, zDerivation_zAxBot hbot, zReg_zAxBot s, zFresh_zAxBot s, (zSeqAnt_zAxBot s).trans (…),
   by rw[fstIdx_zAxBot, fstIdx_zK], ⟨zero_le, icmp_zero_pos hposlast, isNF_zero⟩⟩`. The ex-falso obligation is
   now ISOLATED to the single top-level sorried intro `zDerivation_zAxBot {s} (hbot : inAnt (^⊥) (seqAnt s)) :
   ZDerivation (zAxBot s)` (`Crux2Blueprint:~3367`). `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` axioms unchanged, no drift.
2. **⏭ NEXT — discharge `zDerivation_zAxBot` = ZPhi disjunct #9 + the ripple (the one remaining ex-falso piece).**
   Add the disjunct `(∃ s, d = zAxBot s ∧ inAnt (^⊥) (seqAnt s))` to `ZPhi` (`:5458`), `zphi_iff`,
   `zphi_monotone`, `zphi_strong_finite`, `zblueprint` (Σ+Π, add a `qqFalsum`/`inAnt` clause), `zPhi_definable`.
   Then thread a 9th branch through the ~125 `zDerivation_iff.mp` rcases (compiler-driven: each missing-pattern
   error → add `| ⟨s, h, hbot⟩` and the obvious branch; new leaf is degree-0, most branches mirror tag-0/7).
   Finally `zDerivation_zAxBot hbot := zDerivation_iff.mpr (Or.inr⁸ ⟨s, rfl, hbot⟩)` → DROPS that sorry → the
   ex-falso `exFalsoClose` is FULLY real. Build green at the end (ATOMIC — the disjunct breaks all rcases until
   the last is patched; ~2 lap effort; precedent lap-116 zAx1). Then `residual` (:3451) still needs (ii) C-exit
   R-intro replay + (iii) tag-5/6 thread-escape; closing those + zAxBot DROPS the `genReduct_chain_noRedex_anySucc`
   whole-lemma sorry.

**DIRECTION note (for the next altitude lap):** DIRECTION.md's CURRENT DIRECTIVE (lap-161) MANDATED the ex-falso
"by ROUTE 4 (induction on C); pure ASSEMBLY". That is REFUTED here in-kernel. Its own §2 fallback (the `zAxBot`
disjunct) is the correct route. Update the CURRENT DIRECTIVE to make route 2 primary (grind laps may not edit it).

## Lap 161 (DEEP REFLECTION + ex-falso isolation) — directive RE-SYNCED; ⊥-exit ex-falso named + its design wall pinned

**Build 🟢 1326 (exit 0); `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` = `[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms, no
drift). HEAD after this lap's grind commit.** Altitude lap — synthesis (DIRECTION.md lap-161, REFLECTION-2026-06-27-lap161.md,
STATUS.md) committed at `3310b26`; see those for the full direction call. Grind delta below.

### What the grind did
Isolated the ⊥-exit ex-falso out of the context-free `residual` (`Crux2Blueprint:3451`) into a NAMED,
properly-typed sub-`sorry` `exFalsoClose : inAnt (^⊥ : V) (seqAnt s) → GenReductCert (zK s r ds)` (added after
`leafCloseC`, ~:3471), and rewired the two ⊥-exit dispatch sites (tag-0, tag-7) from `exact residual` to
`exact exFalsoClose (hbot ▸ hDin)`. Build green, 0 math axioms. This NAMES the one genuinely-new anySucc content
(per DIRECTION.md lap-161 mandate) and pins its real wall (below). `residual` still covers (ii) C-exit R-intro
replay + (iii) tag-5/6 thread-escape.

### ⭐ KEY FINDING — the ⊥-exit ex-falso is a DESIGN question, not a quick lemma
`exFalsoClose` needs `⊥ ∈ seqAnt s ⟹ a low-ordinal ZDerivation of seqAnt s → seqSucc s` (= `Γ→C`, `C = seqSucc s`
arbitrary). I confirmed against the 8-rule `ZPhi` list (`InternalZ:5458`):
- NO single Z-rule fires: `zAtom`/`zAx1` (tags 0,7) need the SUCCEDENT `C ∈ Γ` (not `⊥`); `zAxNeg` (tag 6) needs a
  complementary `inegF q, q ∈ Γ` PAIR (not bare `⊥`; and `⊥ = 0 ≠ inegF q = qqOr (neg q) ⊥`); tags 1-5 are
  R-intros/cut/L-axiom, none keyed by `⊥∈Γ`.
- **The naive "structural induction on the UFormula `C`" FAILS at the atom base case.** Atoms have NO R-introduction
  rule — `Γ→atom` is derivable ONLY by the leaf axiom (`atom ∈ Γ`). So `⊥∈Γ ⟹ Γ→atom` (atom ∉ Γ) cannot be built by
  R-intros. **This Z-system has NO ⊥-left (ex-falso-from-⊥) rule.**
- So `⊥∈Γ ⟹ Γ→C` is NOT admissible as-is. Three routes (pick on a future lap, design call):
  1. **Vacuity** — prove `¬ inAnt (^⊥) (seqAnt s)` from the chain hyps (`zKValidF`/`ZSeqAnt`/`ZFresh`/`ZRegular`),
     then `exFalsoClose := fun h => absurd h hvac`. CLEANEST if true. RISK: antecedents grow via cuts on the
     `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` (`∅→⊥`) path, and an inconsistency proof can cut on `⊥` itself → `⊥` may legitimately
     enter an antecedent. Must CHECK whether the invariants actually forbid it (likely NOT — needs evidence).
  2. **Add a ⊥-left `ZPhi` disjunct** `(∃ s, d = zAxBot s ∧ inAnt (^⊥) (seqAnt s))` deriving `Γ→C` for any `C`
     (mirror tag-6 `zAxNeg`'s succedent-agnostic shape). This is a real datatype extension — a 9th disjunct + the
     ~60-site ripple (cf. the lap-116 `zAx1` tag-7 addition: `monotone`/`StrongFinite`/`zDerivation_iff`/inversions/
     `iotil`/`idg`/`zReg`/`zFresh`/`zSeqAnt`). Heavy but mechanical and PROVEN-doable (lap-116 did exactly this).
  3. **Alternative reduct** — don't derive `Γ→C` fresh; instead, at the ⊥-exit the leaf at jstar derives
     `chainAnt ds jstar → ⊥` via `⊥ ∈ chainAnt ds jstar`. Investigate whether a chain `certReplace`/`certFlatten`
     that REUSES that leaf (rather than re-deriving `C`) gives the õ-drop. Least explored.
- **RECOMMENDED next lap:** route 1 (vacuity) is REFUTED (see refinement below). Best path = a STRUCTURAL
  INDUCTION on `C = seqSucc s` (route 4, NEW — cheaper than the route-2 datatype ripple), with the atom case
  handled by validity, not ex-falso.

### ⭐ REFINEMENT (lap 161, after checking `zInegWff` `InternalZ:1525`) — route 1 REFUTED, route 4 (induction on C) is the path
- **Vacuity (route 1) is REFUTED:** `seqAnt s` is preserved by `certReplace` splices but CHANGES when the
  recursion (`IH`) descends into a premise `znth ds i` (its base antecedent = parent `seqAnt s` + cut formulas
  from earlier chain nodes). An earlier node's succedent CAN be `⊥` (a prior ⊥-exit), so `⊥` legitimately enters
  antecedents as a cut formula ⟹ `⊥ ∈ seqAnt s` IS reachable. Do NOT pursue global vacuity.
- **The ex-falso `⊥∈Γ ⟹ Γ→C` is derivable by induction on `C` EXCEPT at atom-rooted leaves:**
  - `C = inegF p` (`= ¬p ∨ ⊥`): `zInegWff p d0` (`InternalZ:1525`) = the `zIneg` premise `d0` derives
    `Γ,p → ⊥`. Since `⊥ ∈ Γ ⊆ Γ,p`, `d0` is a **leaf** (`zAtom`, succedent `⊥ ∈` antecedent). So `Γ → inegF p`
    is a 2-node `zIneg (zAtom …)` — NO recursion. ✓
  - `C = ^∀ p` (`zIall`): premise derives `Γ → p[eigenvar a]`; RECURSE the ex-falso into the matrix `p`.
  - `C = atom`: NO R-rule (atoms only via the leaf `atom ∈ Γ`). **The genuine gap.** BUT likely VACUOUS: a valid
    chain deriving `Γ → atom` must produce the atom at a leaf (`atom ∈` some node's antecedent), which threads
    (`hthread0`) to `atom ∈ seqAnt s` or an earlier succedent → ultimately `atom ∈ seqAnt s`. If so, `seqSucc s =
    atom ⟹ atom ∈ seqAnt s` ⟹ close by `leafCloseC`, NOT ex-falso. **CHECK** this "atom succedent ⟹ atom∈Γ"
    validity (from `zKValidF`/the chain-exit structure) — if it holds, the atom case never needs ex-falso and the
    whole `exFalsoClose` closes by induction on `C` (`inegF`→leaf, `∀`→recurse, `atom`→leafCloseC).
  - **NEXT lap = build `exFalsoClose` by `IsUFormula`-induction on `C = seqSucc s`** (the `inegF`/`∀` R-intro
    recursion + the atom-validity close), reusing `leafCloseC`. This is route 4 — avoids the route-2 `zAxBot`
    datatype ripple entirely IF the atom-validity holds. Confirm the atom-validity FIRST (it gates the whole route).

### ⭐⭐ DE-RISKED + SHARPENED (lap 161) — route 4 is pure ASSEMBLY; the DOMINANT shape `^∀^k⊥` closes cleanly
- **The dominant ⊥-exit cut-formula shape is `^∀^k⊥`** (∀-tower over the CLOSED matrix `⊥`; established lap-155,
  `p=⊥` via `zAxAllSuccWff`+`eq_falsum_of_substs1_falsum`). Its matrix is `⊥`, NOT an atom ⟹ route 4 closes it
  cleanly as `zIall^k (zAtom)`: the innermost premise derives `Γ+eigenvars → ⊥`, a LEAF (`⊥∈Γ`). The atom gap
  only bites for genuinely atom-MATRIXED succedents (rare/maybe-absent here). So build the `^∀^k⊥` + `inegF` +
  `⊥`-itself cases first; leave a narrow atom-matrix sub-`sorry` if it can't be shown vacuous.
- **All supporting infra EXISTS (verified lap 161) — the build is ASSEMBLY, not new infra:**
  - cert template = `axNegCloseGen` (`Crux2Blueprint:3480`): `Or.inl ⟨reduct, zDerivation_iff.mpr(disjunct),
    zReg_X, zFresh_X, (zSeqAnt_X).trans (seqAntSeqFlag_zK_of_ZSeqAnt hseqant), fstIdx-match, ⟨idg-drop,
    iotil-drop, isNF⟩⟩`.
  - `inegF p` case: reduct `zIneg s p (zAtom s')` with `s'` antecedent `seqAddAnt p (seqAnt s)`, succedent `⊥`
    (leaf, `⊥∈seqAnt s ⊆ seqAddAnt p …`); validity = `zInegWff` (`InternalZ:1525`, = premise `Γ,p→⊥` + `IsUFormula
    p`) + `zInegAntWff`. Builders: `zReg_zIneg`, `zFresh_zIneg`, `zSeqAnt_zIneg`, `fstIdx_zIneg`, `idg_zIneg`,
    `iotil_zIneg` — ALL present. Match `fstIdx_zIneg = ⟨seqAnt s, inegF p⟩` to `fstIdx_zK` via `seqSucc s = inegF p`.
  - `^∀ p` case: reduct `zIall s a p v'` (`zReg_zIall`/`zFresh_zIall`/`zSeqAnt_zIall`/`fstIdx_zIall`/`idg_zIall`/
    `iotil_zIall` present); `v'` from the recursion on the matrix `p` (eigenvar `a` — the one fiddly bit; reuse
    the `zFresh`/`zIallWff` eigenvariable handling already in the repo).
  - ordinal drop: `idg = 0` for the fresh reduct (`idg_zIneg`/`idg_zIall` should reduce); `iotil` finite-head
    `õ`-drops vs `zK` via `iotil_zK`+`finHead_iotil_lt_iseqNaddIdg` (the exact `axNegCloseGen` move).
  - **discriminate `seqSucc s`'s shape** via `IsUFormula` cases / the `qq*`-constructor matchers (the chain's
    `seqSucc s` is a UFormula from `zKValidF`'s succedent-wff conjunct `hss`).
- **EXECUTION ORDER next lap:** (1) `inegF` case (no recursion, cleanest — get the cert tuple compiling); (2)
  `^∀^k⊥` via the `zIall` recursion bottoming at `⊥`; (3) the atom-matrix case — show vacuous (atom succedent ⟹
  atom∈Γ ⟹ `leafCloseC`) or leave a narrow sub-`sorry`. Closing all three DROPS `exFalsoClose`.

### The rest of the residual (unchanged from lap 160)
(ii) C-exit R-intro replay (tag-1/2 major produces `C = seqSucc s` directly) — likely needs the major premise's own
reduct, spliced same-end-sequent. (iii) tag-5/6 thread-escape — shared with `axMajorResidual` (:3735); factor a
`threadEscapeClose`. These remain in `residual` (:3451). Once all three close, `genReduct_chain_noRedex_anySucc`
DROPS → (with the 2 other anySucc leaves) thin-wraps `genReduct_botSucc` → DROPS `axMajorResidual` +
`descent_step_K_noncrit_axMajor`. gDef (:4316) separable.

---

## Lap 160 (WIRE) — genReduct_chain_noRedex_anySucc dispatch wired (load-bearing leaf)

**Build 🟢 1326; `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` = `[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms, no drift). HEAD `d4ce7e3`.**

Executed lap-159 NEXT #1. `genReduct_chain_noRedex_anySucc` (`Crux2Blueprint:3407`) went from a bare
whole-lemma `sorry` to a WIRED §14.254 dispatch with ONE narrow internal `residual` sorry (modelled on the
proven ⊥-version). The {3,4}-producer CORE (heart of crux-2) closes via the general IH +
`certReplace_of_premise_cert`; C-exit leaf/`zAtom`, succedent-agnostic `zAxNeg`, tag-5/6 cut-partner CLIMB
all close. Sorry COUNT unchanged but the leaf is narrowed from opaque → precise residual (DIRECTION.md
"decompose into named src sub-sorries with the skeleton wired" success).

### Kernel findings (lap 160)
- `zAxNeg` is the LONE succedent-agnostic Z-rule (ex-falso); `zAtom`/`zAx1` need `seqSucc s∈Γ`; `zAxAll`
  forces the succedent. ⟹ ⊥-exit escapes (`⊥∈Γ`/`^∀⊥∈Γ ⟹ Γ→C`) have NO single-node reduct.
- ⊥-exit ex-falso has bad ordinals as a single-premise chain wrapper (`ω^õw` can exceed `iseqNaddIdg ds`);
  genuine new infra needed (internal ⊥-elim/weakening or witness-bounded reduct).
- `genReduct_chain_noRedex` (⊥) returns `Or.inl` (certReplace) in all non-sorry branches; whole-chain
  certFlatten does NOT descend standalone ⟹ axMajor must go via the cut-partner climb, not delegation.

### NEXT (priority order)
1. Split `residual` (`:3407`) into: (i) ⊥-exit ex-falso, (ii) C-exit R-intro replay, (iii) tag-5
   climb-escape + tag-6 partial (= shared with `axMajorResidual` `:3683`). Prove (iii) ONCE for both;
   (i) needs new ex-falso infra; (ii) likely internal weakening.
2. `genReduct_chain_hasRedex_anySucc` (`:3391`): ∀-redex CLEAN port (`certFlatten_of_critHalves` off-⊥);
   ¬-redex = `keepTip` (needs ⊥-exit).
3. `ind_reduct_anySucc` (`:3382`): lap-136 unfolding (general — caller passes no closedness).
4. `descent_step_K_noncrit_axMajor` (`:4180`): cut-partner climb → `genReduct_anySucc` → splice (mirror
   `repMajor` `:3930`).
5. Retire the ⊥-stack (only after the 3 anySucc leaves are proven) ⟹ DROP `axMajorResidual` `:3683`.

## Lap 159 (PORT + WIRE) — genReduct_anySucc family in src; {3,4}-producer core of axMajorResidual WIRED

**Build 🟢 1326; `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` = `[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms, no drift).**

Executed the directive's port plan. Three commits:
1. `b7033f7` — certFlatten_of_critHalves generalized off `seqSucc s = ⊥` → `IsUFormula (seqSucc s)` (the
   FLATTEN splice is now succedent-agnostic); PORTED the lap-158 spike `genReduct_anySucc` family to src:
   the entry (code-induction) + `genReduct_anySucc_chain` (dispatcher) PROVEN off `⊥`; three NAMED leaf
   sorries (`ind_reduct_anySucc`, `genReduct_chain_hasRedex_anySucc`, `genReduct_chain_noRedex_anySucc`).
2. `ca8744e` — WIRED `genReduct_anySucc` into `axMajorResidual`: added `repProducerClose` (a {3,4} producer
   `m ≤ j0` closes by `genReduct_anySucc (znth ds m)` → `certReplace_of_premise_cert`), routed the four clean
   {3,4}-producer sites in `tryProducerClose` (tag-3, tag-4, the two climb→{3,4} landings) through it. **The
   IRREDUCIBLE {3,4}-producer core of `axMajorResidual` is now reduced to the proven `genReduct_anySucc` entry
   + its 3 named leaves** — the directive's success metric (decompose into named src sub-sorries WITH the
   skeleton wired) is MET. Residual `axMajorResidual` now = ONLY the general-`C` leaf/escape/R-intro closes.

### NEW finding (lap 159, recorded)
The has-redex ¬-case `keepTip` (`ZDerivation_corrected_haux0_neg_botOrbit` `:738`) GENUINELY needs the ⊥-exit:
it replaces the succedent by the cut formula, so only a ⊥-exit re-validates the rebuilt chain. The ∀-redex
sub-case generalizes cleanly (via the certFlatten generalization). → `genReduct_chain_hasRedex_anySucc`'s
¬-case is a real deep leaf; its ∀-case is a clean port.

### NEXT attack (priority order)
1. **`genReduct_chain_noRedex_anySucc` body** (the load-bearing leaf): port `genReduct_chain_noRedex`'s
   machinery (collapse / climb / closeZAxNeg / tryProducerClose / tag dispatch) to general `C`, `rcases hAj0`
   on the exit. The {3,4}-producer + tag-5/6→producer closes via the GENERAL IH (the same `repProducerClose`
   pattern, IH instead of `genReduct_anySucc`); leaf `C∈Γ`→`zAtom`, axAll sub-(a)→`zAxAll s p' k'`, axNeg→
   `zAxNeg s q` all GENERALIZE (the Z-rules allow any succedent — only the ⊥-exit leaf needs ex-falso, and
   tag-1/2 R-intro-of-`C` is genuinely new). Then `ind_reduct_anySucc` (lap-136 unfolding) and the
   `genReduct_chain_hasRedex_anySucc` ∀-case.
2. **Swap `genReduct_botSucc` → `genReduct_anySucc`** (thin wrapper, drop the `hsucc` arg) and retire the
   ⊥-stack (`genReduct_botSucc_chain` / `genReduct_chain_noRedex` / `genReduct_chain_hasRedex`) once the
   general versions are proven — DROPS `axMajorResidual` outright.
3. `descent_step_K_noncrit_axMajor` (`:3857` twin) then closes the same way via the cut-partner lemmas
   (`majorPrem_zAxAll_cutPartner`/`_zAxNeg_cutPartner`, Γ=∅, already proven) + `genReduct_anySucc`.

## Lap 158 (FRESH-MIND REVIEW + SPIKE) — collapse EXHAUSTED; residual = {3,4}-producer cut-elim; SPIKE settled it by CODE-induction

**Build 🟢 green (1326); real `#print axioms` re-verified: headline `peano_not_proves_goodstein` +
`false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` = `[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms); `peano_not_proves_consistency`
+ `goodsteinSentence_faithful` = `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]` (clean) — no drift.**

### ⭐ SPIKE EXECUTED + DECISIVE (`wip/GenReductAnySucc.lean`, typechecks via `lake env lean`)
The directive-mandated design spike is DONE and the fork is SETTLED in kernel. **Finding: the residual closes by
the EXISTING CODE-induction (`zDerivation_sigma_induction`), NOT an outer degree-induction.** The refactor is
"drop the `seqSucc=⊥` clause," not "add a degree parameter." Two non-sorried lemmas typecheck, proving it:
1. **`genReduct_anySucc`** (= `genReduct_botSucc` with the `seqSucc(fstIdx d)=⊥` antecedent DROPPED): its
   CODE-induction body typechecks unchanged. The `𝚺₁` motive `GenReductCert` is definable WITHOUT the `⊥`-clause
   (`GenReductCert` never mentions `⊥`); the code-IH threads; tag-3/4 delegate to the generalized sub-reducts.
2. **`noRedex_producer_closes`** (non-sorried body): the {3,4} PRODUCER `m` of ANY succedent closes via
   `Or.inl (certReplace_of_premise_cert_anySucc … (IH m …))` where `IH` is the GENERAL IH (no `⊥`-clause). This
   is EXACTLY the move the lap-157 refutation doubted — VALIDATED. **Why it sidesteps the refutation:**
   `certReplace_of_premise_cert` (`Crux2Blueprint:3283`) is ALREADY general-succedent in `m` — its FLATTEN
   rank-headroom comes from the PREMISE's own `irk+1 ≤ idg(premise)` (line 3328-3331), NOT the chain's degree
   (which is what the refutation found un-derivable). The degree headroom is LOCAL to each principal-cut flatten
   (already proven inside `genReduct_chain_hasRedex`), so no GLOBAL degree-induction is needed.

### The PORT plan (next lap, src) — generalize off `seqSucc=⊥`, RAISING the src count = progress
Replace `axMajorResidual` by the producer-splice path; the refactor is exactly THREE generalized sub-lemmas
(plus dropping the `⊥`-clause from the IH threaded through the chain entry). Port `wip/GenReductAnySucc.lean`:
1. ✅ **DONE (lap 158, in-place):** `certReplace_of_premise_cert` (`Crux2Blueprint:3283`) generalized off the
   ⊥-exit — `hbot0 : chainAsucc ds j0 = ⊥` → `hexit : chainAsucc ds j0 = seqSucc s ∨ chainAsucc ds j0 = ⊥`
   (passed straight to `isChainInf_seqInsert`, which already accepted that disjunction; REPLACE branch never
   used it). Two call sites (tag-3/4) now pass `Or.inr hbot0`. Build 🟢 1326, no sorry change. The splice is
   now general-succedent in the chain's exit — the enabler for the {3,4}-producer path.
2. **`ind_reduct_anySucc`** — generalize `ind_reduct_botSucc_of_fresh` off `seqSucc=⊥`. On the residual the
   succedent `C` is a closed ∀-tower `^∀^k⊥`, so `p_ind = C` (`substs1 t p_ind = p_ind`, no free var) ⟹ the
   induction is VACUOUS and the reduct is `d0` (`õ`-drop). (General `C` = the lap-136 unfolding, but the
   residual never needs it.) CHECK first that `zIndWff` admits a vacuous (closed-`C`) zInd.
3. **`genReduct_anySucc_chain`** + its `genReduct_chain_hasRedex`/`genReduct_chain_noRedex` callees —
   generalize off `seqSucc=⊥` to the C-exit (`chainAsucc ds j0 = seqSucc s` from `zKValidF`), drop the
   `⊥`-clause from the IH, and replace `axMajorResidual` with the `noRedex_producer_closes` wiring. The hasRedex
   half is criticality-free already (lap 147); the noRedex half is the lap-155-157 dispatch (mostly portable —
   the leaf/escape/R-intro-kill cases are succedent-agnostic).
Then thread the generalized entry into `genReduct_botSucc` (the `⊥` case is a special instance, so existing
call sites — `descent_step_K_noncrit_repMajor`:3818 etc. — keep working by passing the now-derived C-exit).

### Forbidden / still binding (DIRECTION.md lap-158)
Same-degree `õ`-drop for the {3,4} producer (refuted lap 157); `red`; `iord`-recursion (CODE-induction +
local-degree flatten ONLY — the spike confirms code-induction suffices); `redLeast`/μ-min for gDef; the refuted
`seqUpdate` splice; attacking `descent_step_K_noncrit_axMajor`:3857 / gDef:3980 standalone; off-path dead
red-soundness sorries; M2/M4. ALTITUDE: M2 (Foundation→Z bridge) ~0% built — "only the crux left" ≠ "almost done."

### The three live crux-2 sorries (the only on-path ones)
1. **`axMajorResidual`** (`Crux2Blueprint:3417`, inside `genReduct_chain_noRedex`) — THE crux core. Reached ONLY
   for a NON-LEAF `Rep` producer `m < jstar` (`zInd` tag-3 / sub-`zK` tag-4) genuinely PRODUCING the cut formula.
2. **`descent_step_K_noncrit_axMajor`** (`:3857`, the `Γ=∅` outer twin) — bottoms out in the SAME content (#1).
3. **`exists_sigma1_descending_step` / gDef** (`:3980`) — the Σ₁-definability consumer (separate obligation).

(Off-path dead `red`-soundness sorries {`:82,:1257,:1367,:1563,:1653,:1765,:1868`} — DO NOT ATTACK AS STATED.)

### Why the collapse is EXHAUSTED (laps 155-157 did everything threadable)
The §14.254b major premise `jstar` is an L-axiom (`zAxAll`/`zAxNeg`) on a cut formula. Its active formula(s)
thread via `collapse`/`climb_to_rep_producer` to either Γ (escape — CLOSED) or an upstream producer. Producers:
leaf (tags 0/7) → thread to Γ; R-intro (tags 1/2, π₁(tp)=0) → KILLED by `hnolow` (`rightSym_producer_redex`);
`zAxNeg` (tag 6) producer → CLOSED (`closeZAxNeg`/`axNegCloseGen`, threads both `¬q,q`); `zAxAll` (tag 5)
producer → CLIMBS one rank (`climb_to_rep_producer`, axiom-clean lap 157) → lands on {3,4,6}/escape. **The ONLY
thing left is a {3,4} (`zInd`/`zK`) producer** — it genuinely PRODUCES the cut formula (cannot be threaded away)
and CANNOT be reduced by a same-degree `õ`-drop (REFUTED in-kernel lap 157: `certReplace`/`certFlatten` need
`irk(cutFormula)+1 ≤ idg(zK s r ds)`, NOT derivable — `isChainInf` records only `irk(chainAsucc) ≤ r` and
`idg_zK = max r (iseqMaxIdg−1) ≥ r`, so the cut rank can `= r = idg`, no headroom).

### The residual's two shapes
- **(i) tag-5 + the climb** → cut formula `^∀^k⊥` (k≥1): a ∀-TOWER over the CLOSED matrix `⊥`. DOMINANT — all
  climbing produces ∀-towers over ⊥.
- **(ii) tag-6** → arbitrary `p'` / `inegF p'` (the `p'`-half non-leaf producer at `Crux2Blueprint:3630`).

### MANDATE (DIRECTION.md lap-158): a DESIGN SPIKE FIRST, then port to src — DO NOT refactor the src stack blind
The fix must drop the **DEGREE** (`idg`), not `õ` (lap-157 refutation). The structure is the standard Buchholz
Thm 2.1 cut-elimination: **OUTER induction on the NAT `idg`** (kosher — it is a finite max-cut-rank bound, NOT
`iord`/PRWO-barred) + **INNER code-induction** (`zDerivation_sigma_induction`); eliminate the HIGHEST-rank cuts
first (this is where the `irk < idg` headroom the lap-157 refutation found missing actually appears). Reuse the
`genReduct_chain_hasRedex`/`iRKcCrit` degree-drop engine + the same-end-sequent `certReplace` splice — do not
rebuild them.

**Spike (`wip/`, lap-101/132-style — decisive either way):**
1. Pin the generalized statement: generalize `genReduct_botSucc` / `genReduct_chain_noRedex` / `GenReductCert`
   off `seqSucc = ⊥` to a general succedent `C`, with a degree parameter `D` and the degree-IH "every Rep node
   with `idg ≤ D` has a GenReductCert."
2. CHECK the degree-drop closes BOTH shapes (i) `^∀^k⊥` and (ii) arbitrary `p'`: eliminating the top-rank cut
   lowers `idg` to `D−1` where the degree-IH applies; verify the resulting reduct's `iord` strictly descends
   (the `#`-fold dominates any single premise via `finHead_iotil_lt_iseqNaddIdg`, as in the existing branches).
3. EXPLORE the cheap optimization for shape (i): a ∀-inversion `Γ→^∀⊥ ⟹ Γ→⊥` is VACUOUS-instantiation for the
   closed matrix `⊥` (no eigenvariable bookkeeping) — but it changes the succedent, so it needs a
   change-of-succedent splice (NOT the banked same-end-sequent `certReplace`). Confirm in the spike whether it
   actually undercuts the degree-general route before committing; if not, the degree-general route handles both.
4. PORT the pinned statements to src as named sub-`sorry`s (RAISING the src count = progress), discharging the
   parts that fall out of existing banked lemmas (the leaf/R-intro/escape cases already proven, the descent
   `finHead_*` lemmas, `certReplace_of_premise_cert`).

**FORBIDDEN:** the full src refactor before the spike pins the statement; a same-degree `õ`-drop for the {3,4}
producer (refuted lap 157); `red` witnesses; `iord`-recursion for the construction (degree-induction on the NAT
`idg` + CODE only); `redLeast`/μ-min for gDef; the refuted single-premise `seqUpdate` splice; attacking #2/#3
standalone; the off-path dead `red`-soundness sorries AS STATED; M2/M4 wiring. ALTITUDE CAUTION: M2 (Foundation→Z
bridge) ~0% built + crux-entangled — "only the crux is left" ≠ "almost done."

## Lap 157 (GRIND) — `climb_to_rep_producer` PROVEN (axiom-clean) + wired; tag-5 producer collapses to {3,4,6}/escape

**Build 🟢 green (1326); headline `peano_not_proves_goodstein` + `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty`
`[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms) — no drift. `climb_to_rep_producer` itself is
sorry-FREE + axiom-clean (`[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`, NO `sorryAx`).**

✅ **THE WEDGE PROVEN — `climb_to_rep_producer` (`InternalZ:~9166`, axiom-clean).** A left-axiom major
(`tp = isymLk kk F`, `F = ^∀…` a `^∀`-formula, `F ∈ chainAnt ds jstar`) has its cut formula `F` ALWAYS
produced by a `zInd`/`zK` (tag 3/4) or `zAxNeg` (tag 6) node, or threads to a `^∀`-formula in `Γ`. Mechanism:
thread `F` → escape (`^∀ … ∈ Γ`) or NON-LEAF producer (`leastSucc_in_ant_or_nonleaf`); an R-intro producer
(`zIall`/`zIneg`, right symbol) is killed by `hnolow` (`rightSym_producer_redex`). **The `zAxAll` (tag-5)
producer is NOT an independent gap:** its OWN active `^∀ p'` is again a `^∀`-formula threading one rank UP, so
by a `least_number` search over "`x ≤ j0 ∧ tag x ∈ {3,4,5,6} ∧ chainAsucc ds x` is a `^∀`-formula" the LEAST
such producer cannot be `zAxAll` (it would force a strictly-earlier `^∀`-producer, contradicting minimality).

✅ **WIRED into `genReduct_chain_noRedex`** (`Crux2Blueprint`, commit `34ff2b3`): factored `closeZAxNeg`
(the lap-156 zAxNeg-thread-and-close, now reusable); `tryProducerClose`'s tag-5 (zAxAll) case now CLIMBS →
`closeZAxNeg` on a zAxNeg landing (CLOSES), `axMajorResidual` on {3,4}/escape. So a zAxAll producer whose
climb ends at a `zAxNeg` now CLOSES (strict superset of cases vs lap-156).

🔻 **`axMajorResidual` (`Crux2Blueprint:~3417`) NARROWED to {zInd(3), zK(4)} producers of a `^∀^k⊥` + the
general `^∀^k⊥ ∈ Γ` escape (k≥1).** The tag-5 (zAxAll) producer is GONE from the residual (collapsed by the
climb). Net sorry count still 1→1; open core strictly smaller and SHARPER.

⛔ **REFUTED (kernel-grounded) — the local `certReplace`/2-cut-`certFlatten` (õ-drop) is the WRONG target for
the {3,4} producer.** Reducing a producer of `^∀^k⊥` (a non-⊥ succedent) by a same-end-sequent REPLACE or a
2-cut FLATTEN requires `irk(cutFormula)+1 ≤ idg(zK s r ds)`, which is **NOT derivable**: `isChainInf` records
only `irk(chainAsucc ds i) ≤ r` (`InternalZ:1182`) and `idg_zK = max r (iseqMaxIdg ds − 1) ≥ r` — so the cut
formula's rank can be `= r = idg` (off-by-one, no headroom). Concretely `r` may be `1`, `idg = 1`,
`irk(^∀⊥) = 1`, `irk(^∀⊥)+1 = 2 > idg`. **Degree-trade confirmed** (mirrors lap-150/151 has-redex finding):
the producer reduction must drop the DEGREE (`iord`, eliminating the cut on `^∀^k⊥` lowers max cut rank), NOT
`õ` (`iRedDescent`). The `genReduct_botSucc` machinery is `⊥`-succedent-only (`hsucc : seqSucc (fstIdx d) =
⊥`), so it CANNOT reduce a producer deriving `Γ_m → ^∀^k⊥`. Also refuted: degenerate `zInd → d0` (the
`idg_zInd = max(max(idg d0 − 1, …), irk p)` can RAISE the degree).

**NEXT ATTACK (next lap), in priority order:**
1. **Wire `climb_to_rep_producer` at the OUTER level `descent_step_K_noncrit_axMajor` (`:~3826`, Γ=∅).** There
   `seqAnt s = ∅`, so the climb's ESCAPE (`^∀ … ∈ Γ`) is VACUOUS — the tag-5 major collapses cleanly to a
   {3,4,6}-producer (no escape residual). {6} closes; {3,4} is the sharp residual. This DECOMPOSES the
   monolithic `descent_step_K_noncrit_axMajor` sorry into the precise "reduce a {3,4} producer of `^∀^k⊥`"
   obligation. (Needs: map `majorIdx`→the climb's jstar; the `∃ d'`-conclusion + splice via
   `descent_step_K_replace` at the producer index — but see #2 for the reduction itself.)
2. **Generalize `genReduct_botSucc`/`genReduct_chain_noRedex`/`GenReductCert` OFF `seqSucc = ⊥` to a general
   succedent `C` (the principled Buchholz route).** This is the ONLY way to reduce a {3,4} producer deriving
   `Γ_m → ^∀^k⊥` (general succedent). The reduction drops the DEGREE (per the refutation above), so it should
   reuse the `genReduct_chain_hasRedex`/`iRKcCrit` `iord`-degree-drop engine, NOT `iRedDescent`. Big refactor;
   the cut-formula-rank-`< idg` headroom is available in the general framework (eliminate highest cuts first).
3. **CHECK** whether the general `^∀^k⊥ ∈ Γ` escape closes via a k-fold instantiation-cut chain whose degree
   `= irk(^∀^k⊥) ≤ r ≤ idg` (the cut formulas `^∀^j⊥` have rank `j ≤ k`, all `< idg` IF the framework gives
   strict headroom — see #2). At Γ=∅ this escape is vacuous (#1 dodges it).

## Lap 156 (GRIND) — tag-6 sub-case (a) PROVEN + succedent-threading COLLAPSE wired (leaf chains)

**Executed the lap-155 directive's succedent-threading collapse for BOTH tags. Build 🟢 green (1326);
headline + `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` `[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms) — no drift.**

✅ **tag-6 SUB-CASE (a) PROVEN (`Crux2Blueprint`, commit `51312d2`):** the dual of the lap-155 tag-5(a).
`zDerivation_zAxNeg_inv` gives BOTH `inegF p' ∈ Γ'` and `p' ∈ Γ'`; thread both via `hthread0`; both in Γ →
the fresh §5 ¬-axiom `zAxNeg s p'` derives `Γ→⊥` directly (`¬p',p' ∈ Γ ⟹ Γ→anything`), õ-dropping via
`finHead_iotil_lt_iseqNaddIdg` (`iotil_zAxNeg = oAtomLk(inegF p')`, finite head).

✅ **SUCCEDENT-THREADING COLLAPSE — new reusable lemma + wired (commit `d4ecee7`):**
`leastSucc_in_ant_or_nonleaf` (`InternalZ:~9065`) — general-Γ analogue of `chainAsucc_threaded_of_leaf`
that RETURNS the `F ∈ Γ` disjunct (instead of killing it via `seqAnt s = ∅`). The LEAST-indexed premise
`m ≤ n` concluding cut formula `F` is either a LEAF (succedent in its own antecedent → threads to Γ;
leastness kills the earlier-premise disjunct) or a NON-LEAF (`zTag ∉ {0,7}`). Wired via the shared
`collapse` helper inside `genReduct_chain_noRedex`: tag-5 (`F=^∀⊥`) and tag-6 (`F=inegF p'` AND `F=p'`)
sub-case (b) now COLLAPSE leaf cut-partner chains to Γ → the proven sub-case (a) reduct.

🔻 **`axMajorResidual` (`Crux2Blueprint:~3417`) NARROWED to NON-LEAF PRODUCERS ONLY.** The residual is now:
a premise `m < jstar` concluding the cut formula `F` with `zTag (znth ds m) ∈ {1,2,3,4,5,6}`. Net sorry
count still 1→1, open core strictly smaller (leaf chains gone).

✅ **R-INTRO KILLED BY `hnolow` (commit `a0c1524`) — collapse TESTED TO EXHAUSTION (directive precondition
met).** Two new `InternalZ` helpers: `pi2_tp_eq_seqSucc_of_pi1_zero` (a right-symbol premise carries its
succedent as the `tp`-formula) + `rightSym_producer_redex` (a RIGHT-symbol producer `m < jstar` of a
left-axiom major's cut formula `F` forms `isRedexPair ⟪m,jstar⟫ ≤ j0` → contradicts `hnolow`). Wired into
tag-5 (`F=^∀⊥`) and tag-6's `inegF p'` half: the right-symbol (`π₁(tp)=0`) producer is killed; only `Rep`
producers (tags {3,4,5,6}, `π₁(tp)∈{1,2}`) survive. **The directive's "R-intro→`hnolow`" step is now
machine-verified; the lap-136 general-succedent reduct is UN-FORBIDDEN for the residual.**

✅ **zAxNeg PRODUCER base case CLOSED (commit `7905f35`).** Generalized `collapse` to any `i ≤ j0` (thread a
PRODUCER's own antecedent); `axNegCloseGen` (general `zAxNeg s q` reduct, witness index supplies the õ);
`tryProducerClose` dispatches a Rep producer by constructor — the `zAxNeg` producer (itself a ¬-axiom
`Γₘ→anything` from `¬q,q∈Γₘ`) threads BOTH `¬q` and `q` to Γ → `zAxNeg s q` derives `Γ→⊥` directly. Wired
into tag-5 + tag-6-inegF non-leaf branches.

🔻 **`axMajorResidual` now = {zInd (3), zK (4), zAxAll (5)} producers + the threading-hits-deeper-producer
recursion.** Reducing the chain past these is the narrowed lap-136 target (`Γ→^∀⊥` etc., NOT "arbitrary C").
Net sorry count still 1→1, open core now precisely the deep general-succedent constructions.

**NEXT ATTACK (next lap) — the general-succedent reduct, by producer constructor:**
1. **zAxAll/zAxNeg producers (axioms, NO sub-derivations) — likely the WEDGE.** A `zAxAll s_m (^∀⊥) k_m`
   producer of `^∀⊥` has active formula `^∀(^∀⊥)` (rank+1) in its antecedent; `hthread0 m` threads it →
   `^∀(^∀⊥)∈Γ` or a deeper producer. Rank is bounded by `r` (`hrank0`), so the climb terminates → bottoms
   out at `^∀^k⊥ ∈ Γ`. Reduct = a 2-cut `zK [d_a, d_b]`: `d_a = zAxAll` derives `Γ→^∀⊥` (from `^∀(^∀⊥)∈Γ`),
   `d_b = zAxAll s ⊥ 0` derives `^∀⊥,Γ→⊥`; the cut composes to `Γ→⊥`. Build as a `certReplace`/`certFlatten`;
   prove the õ-descent of the 2-cut chain. Start with the ONE-STEP case (`^∀(^∀⊥)∈Γ` directly).
2. **zInd producer concluding `^∀⊥`** — `substs1 t p_ind = ^∀⊥` forces `p_ind = ^∀⊥`; the induction reduct
   is the lap-136 unfolding `⟨d0, d1[a:=0..k-1]⟩` (now un-forbidden, narrowed to `Γ→^∀⊥`). CHECK first
   whether `zIndWff` even ADMITS a sound zInd concluding a closed ∀-sentence (it may be vacuous).
3. **zK producer (sub-chain concluding `^∀⊥`)** — recurse the chain reduction at general succedent.
   Likely needs `genReduct_chain_noRedex` generalized off `seqSucc s = ⊥` (the genReduct_botSucc
   generalization the lap-154 handoff flagged). Hardest; defer behind 1+2.

## Lap 155 (GRIND) — DONE: ordinal lemmas + tag-5 sub-case (a) PROVEN; residual = tag-5(b) + tag-6

**Executed the lap-155 course-correction (below) end-to-end for the dominant case. Build 🟢 green (1326);
headline + `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` `[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms) — no drift.**

✅ **DONE step 1 (ordinal lemmas, `InternalZ`, commit f922831):** `finHead_lt_omega_pow` (finite-head
`X ≺ ω^X`), `finHead_iotil_lt_iseqNaddIdg` (finite-head fold-summand `≺` the `#`-fold), `icmp_lt_trans`
(unbounded ≺-transitivity wrapper over the bounded `icmp_trans`). Reusable for any nonzero-õ reduct.

✅ **DONE step 2, tag-5 SUB-CASE (a) (`Crux2Blueprint`, commit e0ac99a):** proven INLINE in
`genReduct_chain_noRedex`'s tag-5 branch (no separate `majorPrem_*_cutPartner` generalization needed — the
chain's own `hthread0` hypothesis is in scope). Mechanism: ⊥-exit + `zAxAllSuccWff` ⟹ `p'=⊥`
(`eq_falsum_of_substs1_falsum`); `hthread0 jstar` splits `^∀⊥ ∈ chainAnt ds jstar` into `^∀⊥ ∈ Γ` (the fresh
`zAxAll s ⊥ 0` reduct derives `Γ→⊥`, õ-dropping via the step-1 ordinal lemma) ∨ cut-partner (residual). The
collapse approach is now MACHINE-VALIDATED for the dominant case.

🔻 **`axMajorClose` → `axMajorResidual` (NARROWED sorry, `Crux2Blueprint:~3502`).** Net sorry count 1→1 but
the open core is strictly smaller. Remaining:
- **tag-5 SUB-CASE (b)** — the active `^∀⊥` is the succedent of an upstream cut-partner `i' < jstar` (`heq :
  ^∀⊥ = chainAsucc ds i'`). Collapse it: case-split `i'`'s constructor — leaf → `chainAsucc_threaded_of_leaf`
  threads `^∀⊥` further toward Γ; direct R-intro `zIall` → contradicts `hnolow` (would `isRedexPair` jstar);
  `zK` sub-chain → recurse the threading; the lone genuine residual is a `zInd` concluding `^∀⊥` (CHECK
  derivable — `zDerivation_zInd_inv` succedent is `substs1 t p_ind`; can it be a ∀-formula?). KEY OPEN PIECE:
  a SUCCEDENT-threading invariant (the existing `hthread0` is ANTECEDENT-only) OR iterate `hthread0` on the
  cut-partner's own antecedent (since `i'` Rep ⟹ `^∀⊥` ∈ its antecedent or threads).
- **tag-6 (`zAxNeg`) — both sub-cases.** STRUCTURALLY DIFFERENT from tag-5: `zDerivation_zAxNeg_inv` gives
  `IsUFormula p ∧ inegF p ∈ Γ ∧ p ∈ Γ` (NO `zAxAllSuccWff`, so NO `p=⊥` collapse). The reduct `zAxNeg s p`
  needs BOTH `inegF p ∈ Γ` AND `p ∈ Γ` threaded to the outer Γ. Its descent reuses the SAME ordinal lemma
  (`iotil_zAxNeg = oAtomLk(inegF p)`, also finite head). NEXT: thread both `inegF p` and `p` via `hthread0`;
  if both land in Γ → fresh `zAxNeg s p` reduct (dual of tag-5(a)); else cut-partner residual.

**NEXT ATTACK (next lap):** tag-6 sub-case (a) (dual of the proven tag-5(a), reuses the ordinal lemma) is the
lowest-risk next DROP; then the sub-case (b) succedent-threading collapse (the genuine remaining content).

## Lap 155 (FRESH-MIND REVIEW) — COURSE-CORRECTION: tag-5/6 = SUCCEDENT-THREADING COLLAPSE, not lap-136

**Supersedes the lap-154b "(b) = lap-136" framing below.** Build 🟢 green (1326); headline `[propext, sorryAx,
choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms); faithful/consistency clean; statement re-audited — no drift. The whole
M1b-term termination crux is now the SINGLE open leaf `axMajorClose` (`Crux2Blueprint:3418`), the tag-5/6
L-axiom cut-partner branch of `genReduct_chain_noRedex`. (lap-152's mandate is DONE: hasRedex DROPPED lap 153,
noRedex 6/8 PROVEN lap 154.)

**The structural insight (kernel-grounded this review).** Finding 1 (lap-154b, kept): the tag-5 major
`zAxAll s' p' k'` satisfies `zAxAllSuccWff` (`seqSucc s' = substs1 k' p'`); the ⊥-exit forces `seqSucc s' = ⊥`,
so `eq_falsum_of_substs1_falsum` gives `p' = ⊥` and the **cut formula is `^∀⊥`** (dually `inegF ⊥` for tag 6).
The major's active formula `^∀⊥` sits in ITS antecedent (`zDerivation_zAxAll_inv` → `inAnt (^∀⊥) (seqAnt s')`),
and the chain's own `hthread` (= the `genReduct_chain_noRedex` hyp `hthread0`, also the `isChainInf` threading
the existing `majorPrem_zAxAll_cutPartner` consumes) splits it:
- **(a) `^∀⊥ ∈ Γ = seqAnt s`** — the ESCAPE; LIVE at `Γ≠∅` (dies only at `seqAnt s=∅`, where the existing
  `*_cutPartner` kills it via `simp [inAnt, lh_empty]`).
- **(b) `∃ i' < jstar, ^∀⊥ = chainAsucc ds i'`** — a strictly-earlier premise CONCLUDING `^∀⊥`.

**The key:** under `hnolow` (no redex pair below j0) a **direct R-intro `zIall` of `^∀⊥` below j0 is
IMPOSSIBLE** — `(i', jstar)` would be an `isRedexPair` (`InternalZ:4820`: i-end right-symbol `π₁(tp)=0`, j-end
left-symbol `π₁(tp)=1`, SAME cut formula — exactly the `(zIall ^∀p, zAxAll ^∀p)` shape; VERIFIED the def fires).
So `^∀⊥` is **never CREATED** below j0 — it can only thread up from Γ. This OBVIATES the lap-136 general
induction reduct for tag-5/6 (the handoff's pessimistic read); the genuine residual is at most a single
narrow case (a `zInd` concluding `^∀⊥`).

**ATTACK TREE (decompose `axMajorClose` into named src sub-`sorry`s — raising the count is progress):**
1. **[teed-up first DROP] 2 reusable ordinal lemmas** — `w < ω^w`: `icmp w (ocOadd w 1 0) = 0` for NF
   `w < ε₀` (order-induction on the CNF spine, ~30-50 lines; cf. the `iseqNaddIdg ≠ 0` positivity proof at
   `Crux2Blueprint:3395-3410` which already uses `inadd_left_mono`/`icmp_pos_zero`/`isNF_omega_pow`); and the
   **summand-≤-fold** `icmp (ocOadd (iotil (znth ds jstar)) 1 0) (iseqNaddIdg ds) = 0` (a single `#`-summand ≤
   the whole `#`-fold). Self-contained, clean, REUSED by every nonzero-õ reduct from here on.
2. **sub-case (a) — `axLeafClose`** (the `^∀⊥ ∈ Γ` analogue of the existing `leafClose` at
   `Crux2Blueprint:3420`): generalize `majorPrem_zAxAll_cutPartner`/`_zAxNeg_cutPartner` (`InternalZ:9329/9357`)
   off `seqAnt s = ∅` so the threading RETURNS the `^∀⊥ ∈ Γ` disjunct (don't kill it); then the fresh axiom
   `zAxAll s ⊥ k'` (NOT `zAtom` — the cut formula `^∀⊥`, not `⊥`, is in Γ) derives `Γ→⊥` directly. Validity:
   `seqSucc s = ⊥ = substs1 k' ⊥`, `^∀⊥ ∈ seqAnt s`. õ-drop: `iotil(zAxAll) = oAtomLk(^∀⊥) ≠ 0` (`InternalZ:2428`)
   `< iseqNaddIdg ds` by the lemma-1 ordinal facts. Reg/fresh/seqAnt for `zAxAll` are free (mirror `zReg_zAtom`
   etc.). CLOSES sub-case (a).
3. **collapse sub-case (b) into (a)** — `^∀⊥ = chainAsucc ds i'`, case-split on i''s constructor:
   - leaf (`zAtom`/`zAx1`): `^∀⊥ ∈` its own antecedent → `chainAsucc_threaded_of_leaf` (EXISTS, used by
     `majorIdx_botOrbit_reducible:9292`) threads `^∀⊥` to Γ → sub-case (a).
   - direct R-intro (`zIall`): forms `isRedexPair` with jstar → contradicts `hnolow`. IMPOSSIBLE (verified).
   - sub-chain (`zK`): succedent threads to its own major premise → recurse the threading downward.
   - **the lone genuine residual: a `zInd` concluding `^∀⊥`.** FIRST check whether a sound `zInd` can even
     conclude a `^∀`-formula (its succedent is `substs1 t p_ind` per `zDerivation_zInd_inv`; `^∀⊥` would force
     `p_ind` to be a ∀-shaped matrix). If NOT derivable, the collapse is TOTAL and lap-136 is fully obviated for
     tag-5/6. Only if it survives does the lap-136 unfolding return — and then as a NARROW `Γ→^∀⊥` target.

**Success = a src sorry drops (lemma 1 + sub-case (a) is the bar).** Closing all of `axMajorClose` ⟹
`genReduct_chain_noRedex` LAST leaf gone ⟹ `genReduct_botSucc` PROVEN ⟹ outer `axMajor`/gDef collapse.
**Forbidden:** the lap-136 reduct as the primary attack before the collapse is tested to exhaustion.

## Lap 154b — REFINED: the tag-5/6 cut-partner is the lap-136 Ind-unfolding wall (not a quick ⊥-generalization)
> **⚠️ SUPERSEDED by lap-155 above** — the "(b) = lap-136" reading is too pessimistic; `hnolow` forbids
> *creating* `^∀⊥`, so the cut-partner collapses to the leaf-escape. Kept for the Finding-1/2/3 analysis.

**Crux-understanding advance (corrects the lap-154 handoff's over-optimistic "just generalize
`genReduct_botSucc` off ⊥").** Investigated the ONE remaining open leaf of `genReduct_chain_noRedex`
(`axMajorClose`, the tag-5/6 L-axiom case). Build still 🟢 green (1326), headline 0 math axioms.

**Finding 1 — the major has `p = ⊥`.** A tag-5 ⊥-exit major `zAxAll s' p' k'` satisfies `zAxAllSuccWff`
(`InternalZ:1559`): `seqSucc s' = substs1 (numeral k') p'`. Since the ⊥-exit forces `seqSucc s' = ⊥`,
`eq_falsum_of_substs1_falsum` gives **`p' = ⊥`** — so the active/cut formula is `^∀⊥` (dually `inegF ⊥`
for tag 6). Same `p=⊥` collapse as the Ind case (`ind_reduct_botSucc_of_fresh`).

**Finding 2 — the general-succedent route's Ind base IS lap-136.** `ind_reduct_botSucc_of_fresh`
(`Crux2Blueprint:2776`) is fundamentally ⊥-specific: it derives `p = ⊥` (`eq_falsum_of_substs1_falsum`)
and uses the resulting `substs1 t ⊥ = ⊥` collapse to build the 2-step `iIndReductSeqG … 1` reduct. For a
cut-partner deriving `Γᵢ'→^∀⊥` that is a `zInd` concluding `^∀⊥` (induction concluding a ∀-formula —
TOTALLY normal in PA-proof embeddings), reducing it needs the FULL induction unfolding
(`⟨d0, d1[a:=0..k-1]⟩`, `k = value of t`) — exactly the lap-136 hard target
(`ind-reduct-false-target-lap136`). So "generalize `genReduct_botSucc` off ⊥" is NOT a mechanical refactor.

**Finding 3 — tag-5/6 splits into two sub-cases (via generalizing the cut-partner identification off
`seqAnt s = ∅`, the SAME `inAnt V Γ` generalization the leaf-escape did):**
- **(a) side-formula `^∀⊥ ∈ Γ`** — fresh `zAxAll s ⊥ k'` directly derives `Γ→⊥` (`^∀⊥ ∈ Γ`,
  `seqSucc s = ⊥ = (⊥)[k']`); it is a sound REPLACE reduct. BUT `iotil_zAxAll = oAtomLk(^∀⊥) ≠ 0`
  (`InternalZ:2428`), so the descent needs **`iotil(zAxAll) < iseqNaddIdg ds`** — i.e. two NEW reusable
  ordinal lemmas: `w < ω^w` (`icmp w (ocOadd w 1 0) = 0`, all NF `w<ε₀`) + "a summand `ω^{iotil(znth ds
  jstar)}` is `≤` the `#`-fold `iseqNaddIdg ds`". ~30-line plumbing; closes sub-case (a) cleanly.
- **(b) upstream cut-partner `i' < jstar` producing `^∀⊥`** — Rep node (tag 3/4, NOT a direct R-intro by
  `hnolow`) deriving `Γᵢ'→^∀⊥`. Reducing it = the general-succedent reduction = **Finding 2 = lap-136**.

**NEXT ATTACK (pick one):**
1. **Cheap green split:** prove the 2 ordinal lemmas + the cut-partner identification generalization,
   close sub-case (a), leave (b) as the named lap-136 residual. Shrinks the wall.
2. **Hardest-first:** attack lap-136 directly — the general induction reduct `⟨d0, d1[a:=0..k-1]⟩`,
   `k = value of t` (the "substituted multi-step chain", `ind-reduct-false-target-lap136`). This is the
   genuine deepest crux; closing it unblocks BOTH the tag-5/6 cut-partner AND general-succedent genReduct.

## Lap 154 — `genReduct_chain_noRedex` 6/8 branches PROVEN; Γ≠∅ leaf-escape DROPPED

**Advance on the crux:** `genReduct_chain_noRedex` (`Crux2Blueprint:3365`) — MASTER KEY #2, the §14.254
chain recursion — decomposed by the LEAST ⊥-exit `jstar`'s tag and **6 of 8 branches PROVEN at general
Γ** (the selection itself is Γ-general via `least_number`, no `seqAnt s = ∅`). Build 🟢 green (1326);
`false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` trace unchanged `[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms). Net
sorry count for the lemma 1→1 (the dual tag-5/6 cases consolidated into one `axMajorClose` sorry).

- **tags 3/4 (§14.254a Rep-major)** — major premise is a Rep node deriving `Γⱼ→⊥`; reduce by the IH →
  `certReplace_of_premise_cert` (Γ-general, banked lap-153b). The genuine cert-consumption content.
- **tags 0/7 (NOVEL leaf escape)** — at Γ≠∅ a leaf ⊥-exit threads (by leastness) to `⊥ ∈ Γ`; then the
  trivial axiom `zAtom s` (`iotil = 0`) derives `Γ→⊥` directly and is a sound `õ`-dropping reduct of the
  nonempty chain (`iseqNaddIdg ds ≠ 0`). Reusable `leafClose` (`~:3413`). Axiom-clean.
- **tags 1/2** — impossible (succedent `^∀p`/`inegF p ≠ ⊥`).

**REMAINING = the ONE crux residual: tag-5/6 cut-partner (`axMajorClose`, `~:3411`).** L-axiom major
(`red`-FIXPOINT) → active formula threads to an upstream Rep cut-partner `i' < jstar` deriving **`Γᵢ'→^∀p`**
(NOT ⊥; `i'` is Rep because `hnolow` forbids a redex below `j0`).
**THE BLOCKER:** `genReduct_botSucc` is `⊥`-ONLY — its IH never reduces a `Γ→^∀p` node.
**NEXT ATTACK (own lap):** generalize `genReduct_botSucc` (+ `_chain` + tag-3 base
`ind_reduct_botSucc_of_fresh` + `genReduct_chain_noRedex`'s IH) from succedent `⊥` to an arbitrary
`IsUFormula` succedent `C` (the §14.253/§14.254 dichotomy is succedent-agnostic; only the Ind-reduct base
and `chainAsucc · = ⊥` plumbing are ⊥-specific). Also generalize `majorPrem_zAxAll_cutPartner`/
`_zAxNeg_cutPartner` off `seqAnt s = ∅` the SAME way the leaf escape did (the `V ∈ Γ` branch → direct
certReplace, no cut). Then tag-5/6 reduces `i'` by the generalized IH at succedent `^∀p`/`inegF p` and
feeds `certReplace_of_premise_cert` at `m = i'`.

## Lap 153 — MASTER KEY #1 `genReduct_chain_hasRedex` DROPPED (axiom-clean)

**Advance on the crux:** `genReduct_chain_hasRedex` (`Crux2Blueprint:3048`) sorry → PROVEN,
`#print axioms`-clean `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`. The §14.253 principal cut at the GENERAL `Γ→⊥` level
(Γ nonempty) off `red`, returning the FLATTEN `GenReductCert` (`Or.inr`). New shared helper
`certFlatten_of_critHalves` (`~:2978`). Build 🟢 green (1326); `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` trace unchanged
`[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms). This validates the `GenReductCert` FLATTEN
machinery end-to-end. crux-2 live leaves: **4 → 3** {noRedex :3294, axMajor :3507, gDef :3630}.

**Method (reusable):** the two FLATTEN halves `a ⊢ Γ→C`, `b ⊢ C,Γ→⊥` are the `iCritReductSeq` PREMISES of
the proven `iRKcCrit` reduct (`iRKcCrit d = zK s (r−1) (iCritReductSeq a b)`). EXTRACT their 4 invariants by
premise-inversion (`zDerivation_zK_inv`/`*_zK_premise` at idx 0,1) rather than rebuilding. N2 per-half
`õ`/`idg` drops: `iotil_zK`/`idg_zK` ignore `fstIdx`, so `iotil_zK_lt_replace`/`idg_zK_le_replace` discharge
them from the N1 `iRedDescent` records (`critReductCorr`/`critReductNeg` at redexI/redexJ). `irk C+1 ≤ idg d`
= `irk_cutFormula_lt` + `r_le_idg_zK`. `Seq (seqAnt s)` = `seq_seqAnt_zK` (lap-152 fold).

**SPLICE CORE LANDED (lap 153b):** `certReplace_of_premise_cert` (`Crux2Blueprint:~3290`, axiom-clean) — a
reduced premise's `GenReductCert` (REPLACE or FLATTEN) → parent `certReplace`, by splicing at `m`
(`seqUpdate` / `seqInsert` rank `max r (irk C)`). Both keep `fstIdx=s`, lower `õ`, don't raise `idg`. **Γ
-AGNOSTIC** (`ZDerivation_iCritAux_of`/`isChainInf_seqInsert` never need `seqAnt s=∅`). This is the "doing"
half of the §14.254 recursion, now banked at the general `Γ→⊥` level. The orbit consumer
`descent_step_K_noncrit_repMajor` → `descent_step_K_replace`/`_spliceHalves` already validated the cert
shapes.

**REMAINING WALL — `genReduct_chain_noRedex` (`Crux2Blueprint:~3380`) = the Γ≠∅ major-premise SELECTION.**
The splice is solved; the open piece is *which* premise to reduce. No redex below `j0` ⟹ major tag ∈{3,4,5,6}
(`majorPrem_tag_mem`). tags 3/4 (`Rep`): reduce `znth ds (majorIdx)` via IH → `certReplace_of_premise_cert`
at `m = majorIdx`. tags 5/6 (L-axiom): identify the upstream `Rep` cut-partner i′ via
`majorPrem_zAxAll_cutPartner`/`_zAxNeg_cutPartner`, reduce IT. **THE BLOCKER:** `majorPrem_tag_mem`,
`majorIdx_botOrbit_reducible`, and both `*_cutPartner` (all `InternalZ:~9259-9400`) require
`hant : seqAnt s = ∅`. At `Γ≠∅` a tag-5/6 active formula `V` (`^∀p`/`inegF p`) could be `inAnt V Γ` (a side
formula threaded from the antecedent) rather than the succedent of an earlier R-intro — so the cut-partner
disjunct no longer falls out of the threading (cf. `majorPrem_zAxAll_cutPartner` line 9350, which closes the
`inAnt V ∅` branch by `simp [lh_empty]`).
**NEXT ATTACK:** generalize the threading conclusion to `inAnt V (seqAnt s) ∨ ∃ i′<j, cut-partner`. In the
`V ∈ Γ` case the major premise is a NON-principal side-formula axiom — its §14.254 reduct keeps `V` in the
antecedent (no cut needed); this should reduce to a tag-3/4-style `certReplace` directly (the axiom node's
own reduct), OR show the `V ∈ Γ` ⊥-orbit case is vacuous/handled by the existing repMajor. Decompose
`genReduct_chain_noRedex` into the 3/4 branch (DONE-able now via the splice core) + the 5/6 branch (needs the
generalized cut-partner) as named src sub-`sorry`s next lap.

## Reflection — 2026-06-27 (lap 152, DEEP REFLECTION; prev altitude lap-143)

**Build re-verified 🟢 green (1326). In-kernel: headline `[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math
axioms); `goodsteinSentence_faithful` + `peano_not_proves_consistency` `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`;
statement re-audited — no drift.** Full write-up: `REFLECTION-2026-06-27-lap152.md`. Binding directive set:
`DIRECTION.md` CURRENT DIRECTIVE (lap-152).

**Direction call: KEEP** — the existence-form pivot off `red` + the lap-150 code-recursion frame
`genReduct_botSucc` (the `Γ→⊥` reduction by strong induction on derivation CODE) are both correct and the
trajectory is healthy. Laps 144→151 are genuine steady crux DROPS (live path off `red` 144; `descent_step_Ind`
146; §5.2 has-redex 147; tag-3 freshFlag 149; code-recursion frame 150; in-kernel refutation of the
`seqUpdate` splice + FLATTEN engine `descent_step_K_spliceHalves` + false `descent_step_K_splice` DELETED 151).
The lap-143 worries (banking-not-wiring, witnessing with `red`) are RESOLVED.

**KEEP doing:** decompose-and-DROP on the crux; in-kernel refutation before grinding a suspect lemma
(lap-151 model); judge-convergence checks; commit every green build; honest disclosed sorries that RAISE the
src count when they decompose the crux.

**STOP / watch:**
- Do NOT attack `descent_step_K_noncrit_axMajor` (`:3226`) standalone — it is the `Γ=∅` special case of
  `genReduct_chain_noRedex`'s cut-partner branch; attacking it separately re-derives the master-key
  combinatorics twice.
- Do NOT attack `gDef` (`:3349`) in parallel — it needs the *constructive* reduct the `GenReductCert`
  supplies; sequence it AFTER the master keys (μ-min REFUTED lap-139, wrong-polarity totality guard).
- Do NOT re-introduce the single-premise `seqUpdate`+combined-`iord` splice (refuted in-kernel lap 151).
- Do NOT witness with `red`; do NOT use `iord`-recursion for the construction; do NOT treat the zSeqAnt fold
  as engine-work-for-its-own-sake.

**Single highest-value next target: DROP `genReduct_chain_hasRedex` (`Crux2Blueprint:2989`) via the zSeqAnt
tag-4 `Seq (seqAnt s)` fold.** Change `zSeqAntNext`'s tag-4 branch (`Zsubst:2003`) from
`if zTag d = 4 then 0 else seqAntSeqFlag (fstIdx d)` to **always** `seqAntSeqFlag (fstIdx d)` — the EXACT shape
of the proven lap-149 freshFlag fold / lap-146 zIndWff fold. Ripple: (a) body `Zsubst:2003`; (b) `zSeqAntNextDef`
σ-clause :2012 (drop the `t=4 ∧ fl=0` disjunct → always `fstIdx`+`seqAntSeqFlag`); (c) `zSeqAntNext_defined`
simp :2021-2023; (d) `zSeqAnt_zK` :2164 + `zSeqAnt_zK_premise_zero`; (e) the ~6 `ZSeqAnt_zK_*`/`_iRKcCrit`/
`_of_seqInsert` + orbit-build sites that consumed the old tag-4=0 clause. Then `Seq (seqAnt s)` falls out of
`hseqant` with NO threading; the principal-cut halves' soundness (`ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_all`/`_neg_botOrbit` +
`ZRegular/ZFresh/ZSeqAnt_iRKcCrit`) closes; `genReduct_chain_hasRedex` returns the FLATTEN cert sorry-free
(descent is already FREE from `iord_descent_iRKcCrit_corr_of_redex`/`_neg_of_redex`). **THEN**
`genReduct_chain_noRedex` (the §14.254 recursion via IH + cert re-package; check `majorPrem_zAxAll_cutPartner`/
`_zAxNeg_cutPartner` exist+sorry-free first). Closing both master keys collapses the outer no-redex path
(`axMajor` mechanical) and feeds gDef.

**Why this target:** it is the LAST teed-up tractable DROP; it validates the entire `GenReductCert` FLATTEN
cert machinery end-to-end (exactly as `descent_step_Ind` validated the pivot at lap 146) before the bigger
`noRedex` recursion; and the two master keys are the highest-leverage move on the board (they collapse three
of the four open leaves).

**Altitude caution (newly elevated):** M2 — the Foundation→Z bridge — is ~0% built and crux-entangled. Every
"crux-2 = 4 leaves" statement is scoped to M1b-term (internal termination). After the master keys + gDef land,
a dedicated lap should scope M2 before declaring the endgame single-front. "Only the crux is left" ≠ "almost
done."

---

## lap 151 (latest) — §14.254 splice = FLATTEN not seqUpdate; `descent_step_K_spliceHalves` PROVEN (judge-convergent)
**Operator SOLE-OBJECTIVE = M1b-term.** This lap settled the §14.254 splice decisively — in-kernel, BEFORE
grinding the false lemma — and BUILT the genuine engine. The host dropped a fresh judge note
(`E-2026-06-26-JUDGE-splice-flatten-not-seqUpdate.md`) that reached the IDENTICAL conclusion independently.

### ⚠️ THE FINDING (in-kernel + judge-convergent) — the single-premise `seqUpdate` splice is FALSE
`descent_step_K_splice` (the lap-150b residual) tried: replace premise `i` of a `∅→⊥` chain by a single
same-end-sequent reduct `v` with COMBINED-`iord` drop (`icmp (iord v) (iord (znth ds i)) = 0`), conclude the
outer chain's `iord` drops. **That is unprovable / false.** Mechanism (grounded in `iotil_zK`:2524 +
`idg_zK`:2159 + `iord_descent_cut`:2667): when `v` is a principal-cut reduct it DEGREE-TRADES —
`idg v < idg dⱼ` but `õ v` can RISE (bounded only by `ω^{õ dⱼ}`, the `iRKcCrit` structure
`iord_descent_iCritReduct`:3276). For the outer chain, `õ(zK) = #ⱼ ω^{õ dⱼ}` is `õ`-ONLY and
`idg(zK) = max r (maxdeg−1)` is pinned `≥ r`. So if `dⱼ` is not the strict argmax (another premise ties, or
`r` pins the degree), replacing it by `v` leaves outer `idg` FLAT while outer `õ` RISES → outer `iord`
rises/flat, NOT a descent. `iord_descent_cut`'s two premises (`idg(e)+1 ≤ idg(d)` and `õ(e) ≺ ω^{õ(d)}`) BOTH
fail. (Judge `E-…-splice-flatten`, ~85%; I converged in-kernel before the note arrived.)

### ✅ THE FIX (Buchholz §14.254 case-(ii) = FLATTEN) — `descent_step_K_spliceHalves` PROVEN axiom-clean
Buchholz does NOT keep `dⱼ` as one premise: he REMOVES it and SPLICES its two principal-cut halves
`dⱼ{0}⊢Γⱼ→B`, `dⱼ{1}⊢B,Γⱼ→Aⱼ` into the outer chain ("without completing the third chain-rule inference",
source 486–535). Both halves have `õ` STRICTLY below `õ dⱼ` (the N1 IH auxiliaries), so the outer `õ`-fold
strictly drops (F2 `ω^{õa}#ω^{õb} ≺ ω^{õ dⱼ}`). The genuine ordered-insert object `seqInsert ds i a b`
(lap-87) carries validity; ALL bricks were already proven (`isChainInf_seqInsert`/`zKValidF_seqInsert`/
`ZDerivation_seqInsert_of`/`ZRegular,ZFresh,ZSeqAnt_zK_of_seqInsert`/`iord_descent_seqInsert'`). **Banked
`descent_step_K_spliceHalves`** (`Crux2Blueprint`, after `genReduct_botSucc`): a `∅→⊥` chain whose premise
`i ≤ j0` has principal-cut halves `a,b` (with `õ`-drop + the cut-pair threading `seqAnt(fstIdx a)=Γⱼ`,
`seqSucc(fstIdx b)=Aⱼ`, `hb_ant ⊆ {B}∪Γⱼ`, `irk B + 1 ≤ idg dⱼ`) yields a strictly-`iord`-descending
`ZDerivesEmptyR`. Axiom-clean `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`. **This is the bug-magnet engine the judge
flagged — now machine-checked.**

### ✅ THE DROP LANDED (lap 151b) — `GenReductCert` structured certificate; `descent_step_K_splice` DELETED
Enriched `genReduct_botSucc`'s conclusion to `GenReductCert d` (`certReplace d ∨ certFlatten d`):
`Or.inl` = a single `õ`-dropping REPLACE reduct (`iRedDescent`), `Or.inr` = the two FLATTEN halves with the
cut-pair end-sequents + `õ`-drop. `descent_step_K_noncrit_repMajor` now `rcases` the cert → REPLACE routes
to `descent_step_K_replace` (proven), FLATTEN routes to `descent_step_K_spliceHalves` (proven) — **sorry-FREE**.
**`descent_step_K_splice` (the false sorry) DELETED** → net −1 live src sorry. `GenReductCert_definable`
PROVEN axiom-clean. KEY definability gotchas (banked): (1) split the cert into `abbrev certReplace`/
`certFlatten` + prove each `𝚺₁-Predicate` SEPARATELY then `.or` — `definability` exhausts on the 24-conjunct
flat disjunction AND on the general `Γ-[m+1]` form (state at `𝚺₁` ONLY, the level `zDerivation_sigma_induction`
needs); (2) `simp only [iRedDescent_iff]` BEFORE `definability` (a bare `iRedDescent v d` structure is NOT
auto-decomposed by aesop); (3) inline `inAnt` as its bounded-`∃` (no `Γ-[m+1]-Relation inAnt` instance);
(4) `set_option maxHeartbeats 1600000`. Headline 0 math axioms, no drift; build 🟢 1326.

### ▶ NEXT — the three remaining genuine leaves (all in the FAITHFUL cert form now)
1. **`genReduct_chain_hasRedex`** (`Crux2Blueprint`, the chain's own §14.253 principal cut → FLATTEN cert):
   return `Or.inr` the halves = `iRKcCrit`'s `iCritReductSeq` components `d0,d1`; their `õ`-drop is FREE
   (`iord_descent_iCritReduct`'s `h0o/h1o` inputs). Blocked on the **`Seq (seqAnt s)` / zSeqAnt tag-4 fold**
   (the halves' soundness `ZDerivation d0/d1` needs `Seq (seqAnt s)`; do the fold — handoff lap-150). The
   cut-pair end-sequents (`seqAnt(fstIdx d0)=Γ`, `seqSucc(fstIdx d1)=⊥`, `hb_thr`) come from the `iCritReduct`
   structure; `irk B + 1 ≤ idg d` from T3.4 (`idg_zK_iCritReduct_lt`-adjacent).
2. **`genReduct_chain_noRedex`** (§14.254 recurse): `majorPrem_tag_mem` ⟹ major tag ∈{3,4,5,6}; reduce major
   (3/4) or Rep cut-partner (5/6) by the IH (which now hands back a `GenReductCert`), then re-package as the
   PARENT's `GenReductCert` (REPLACE stays REPLACE; FLATTEN stays FLATTEN, re-based to the parent's end-sequent).
3. **`descent_step_K_noncrit_axMajor`** (tags 5/6) + **gDef** (`exists_sigma1_descending_step`): unchanged.

### (historical) the genReduct certificate enrichment plan (now DONE — kept for the reasoning trail)
The lap-150 `genReduct_botSucc` conclusion (bare `∃ v, … ∧ icmp (iord v) (iord d)=0`) HIDES the halves the
flatten needs (judge's "the IH reaches `dⱼ` but the conclusion it hands back hides `dⱼ{0}/dⱼ{1}`"). Fix
(judge's PREFERRED option a — structured certificate):
1. Define `GenReductCert d : Prop :=`
   `(∃ v, ZDeriv v ∧ inv v ∧ fstIdx v = fstIdx d ∧ iRedDescent v d)   -- REPLACE (õ-drop single)`
   `∨ (∃ a b, ZDeriv a ∧ ZDeriv b ∧ inv a ∧ inv b ∧ seqAnt(fstIdx a)=seqAnt(fstIdx d) ∧`
   `   seqSucc(fstIdx b)=seqSucc(fstIdx d) ∧ (∀ B, inAnt B (seqAnt(fstIdx b)) → B=seqSucc(fstIdx a) ∨ inAnt B (seqAnt(fstIdx d))) ∧`
   `   IsUFormula(seqSucc(fstIdx a)) ∧ IsUFormula(seqSucc(fstIdx b)) ∧ irk(seqSucc(fstIdx a))+1 ≤ idg d ∧`
   `   icmp(iotil a)(iotil d)=0 ∧ icmp(iotil b)(iotil d)=0 ∧ idg a ≤ idg d ∧ idg b ≤ idg d)  -- FLATTEN`
   `inAnt` is a BOUNDED ∀ (membership in a finite seq) ⟹ Δ₁ ⟹ cert is `𝚺₁` ⟹ motive stays `𝚺₁`
   (re-verify `definability` — the judge's flagged risk; watch the unbounded-∀ gotcha on the `∀ B` clause).
2. Change `genReduct_botSucc`/`_chain`/`genReduct_chain_hasRedex`/`_noRedex` conclusions to `GenReductCert d`.
   tag-3 (zInd) → `Or.inl` (the ind reduct IS `iRedDescent`, already proven). tag-4 → delegate.
3. `genReduct_chain_hasRedex` → `Or.inr` the halves = the `iRKcCrit(d)` components `d0,d1` of `iCritReductSeq`;
   their `õ`-drop is `iord_descent_iCritReduct`'s `h0o/h1o` inputs (descent FREE, per judge). STILL blocked on
   the `Seq (seqAnt s)` / zSeqAnt-tag-4 fold for the halves' soundness (`ZDerivation a/b`) — stays a sorry but
   in the FAITHFUL cert form. (Do the zSeqAnt tag-4 fold — handoff lap-150 — to unblock.)
4. `genReduct_chain_noRedex` → recurse via IH (cert), then splice the cert: REPLACE→`descent_step_K_replace`,
   FLATTEN→`descent_step_K_spliceHalves`. Stays a sorry (cert form).
5. `descent_step_K_noncrit_repMajor` consumes the cert from `genReduct_botSucc`: REPLACE→`descent_step_K_replace`
   (PROVEN, `iRedDescent`), FLATTEN→`descent_step_K_spliceHalves` (PROVEN). Stays sorry-FREE.
6. **DELETE `descent_step_K_splice` (the false sorry).** ← THE DROP (net −1 src sorry, path now FAITHFUL).
Pin the splice ORDER against lap87/lap94 (done: `seqInsert` is the in-place ordered object, NOT end-append).
FORBIDDEN: `seqUpdate`/combined-iord single splice (FALSE this lap); `iord`-recursion; `redLeast` for gDef.

---

## lap 150b — `iRedDescent`→`iord` CORRECTION + §14.254 splice isolated (judge-convergent)
**Operator SOLE-OBJECTIVE = M1b-term.** This continuation of lap-150 acted on TWO things: (1) an in-kernel
finding that the lap-150a frame used the WRONG descent measure, and (2) the host-dropped judge review
(`E-2026-06-26-JUDGE-code-recursion-crux.md` + `JUDGE-HANDOFF-2026-06-26-lap150.md`) which INDEPENDENTLY
reached the same correction.

### ⚠️ THE FINDING (in-kernel, then judge-confirmed) — the chain reduct descends via `iord`, NOT `iRedDescent`
The lap-150a frame had `genReduct_botSucc` conclude `iRedDescent v d` (= `idg v ≤ idg d ∧ icmp (iotil v)
(iotil d) = 0 ∧ isNF (iotil v)`, i.e. `õ` STRICTLY drops). **That is FALSE for tag-4 chains:** the principal
cut reduct (`iRKcCrit`) drops via the **DEGREE** (`idg_zK_iCritReduct_lt`: `idg(reduct)+1 ≤ idg d`), NOT via
`õ`. Proof: `iord_descent_iCritReduct` routes through `iord_descent_cut` whose `iotil` premise is
`icmp (iotil e) (ocOadd (iotil d) 1 0) = 0` — against **`ω^{õ d}`**, strictly weaker than against `õ d`; and
`icmp_omega_pow_nadd_lt` concludes against `ocOadd α 1 0` too. So `õ(iRKcCrit) ⊀ õ(chain)` in general ⟹
`iRedDescent (iRKcCrit …) (chain)` is unprovable. (I built `iRedDescent_iCritReduct` bundle twins before
catching this; they're WRONG — saved dead in `scratchpad/lap150-flawed-iRedDescent-bundle.diff`, reverted
from `InternalZ`.) **The judge review reached the identical conclusion:** every `descent_step_*` concludes
`icmp (iord d') … = 0`; the motive must carry the **combined `iord`** descent, not `iRedDescent`.

### ✅ DONE (lap 150b) — corrected the whole `genReduct_botSucc` chain to `iord`-descent
- `genReduct_botSucc` / `genReduct_botSucc_chain` / `genReduct_chain_hasRedex` / `genReduct_chain_noRedex`:
  conclusion + IH changed from `iRedDescent v d` to **`icmp (iord v) (iord d) = 0`** (matrix `𝚫₁` via
  `iord`/`icmp` definability ⟹ motive stays `𝚺₁` ⟹ `zDerivation_sigma_induction` still fires). tag-3
  (`zInd`) PROVEN: `ind_reduct_botSucc_of_fresh`'s `iRedDescent` is converted to `iord` by
  `iord_descent_of_iRedDescent` (Ind genuinely drops `õ`, so `iRedDescent ⟹ iord`). The frame stays
  green; tag-4 still delegates to `genReduct_botSucc_chain` with the per-premise IH.
- **NEW named sub-`sorry` `descent_step_K_splice`** (the genuine Buchholz §14.254 SPLICE, `iord`-monotone
  premise replacement): the `iord`-descent analog of `descent_step_K_replace` (which is `iCritAux`/`iotil`-
  based and does NOT apply when the premise reduct drops via degree). `descent_step_K_noncrit_repMajor` now
  routes through it (was `descent_step_K_replace`). **Bug-magnet** (judge): pin its dispatch against
  `ANALYSIS-…-lap87-splice-order-sensitivity.md` + `…-lap94-splice-dispatch-unfaithful.md` BEFORE grinding.

### ▶ NEXT — the three remaining genuine leaves (all `iord`-descent now), hardest-first
1. **`descent_step_K_splice`** (§14.254 SPLICE, the bug-magnet): prove the outer chain's `iord` is monotone
   under replacing premise `i` by an `iord`-descending reduct `v` (`fstIdx v = fstIdx(znth ds i)`). This is
   the genuine engine the judge flags. Re-read `scratchpad/buchholz-gentzen.txt` §14.254 (lines 480-535) +
   lap87/lap94 ANALYSIS. Likely needs an `iord`-fold-monotonicity lemma for `iCritAux`/`seqUpdate` that does
   NOT assume the `iotil` drop (unlike `iotil_iCritAux_lt`) — handle the degree-traded case.
2. **`genReduct_chain_hasRedex`** (principal cut, `iord`): descent is FREE from the EXISTING
   `iord_descent_iRKcCrit_corr_of_redex`/`_neg_of_redex` (`Crux2Blueprint:2245`/`:2282` — they already give
   `icmp (iord (iRKcCrit …)) (iord (zK s r ds)) = 0`!). The residual is SOUNDNESS
   `ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_all`/`_neg_botOrbit` + invariants `ZRegular/ZFresh/ZSeqAnt_iRKcCrit` — which need
   **`Seq (seqAnt s)`** for the tag-4 chain conclusion. **That is the `Seq (seqAnt s)` GAP (below).**
3. **`genReduct_chain_noRedex`** (recurse via IH + splice): `majorPrem_tag_mem` ⟹ major tag ∈ {3,4,5,6};
   tag-3/4 reduce major by IH, tag-5/6 reduce the Rep cut-partner by IH; splice via the §14.254 splice (#1).

### 🔑 THE `Seq (seqAnt s)` GAP (tag-4 chains) — needed for hasRedex/noRedex soundness; fix = zSeqAnt fold
`ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_all`/`_neg_botOrbit` (soundness) need `Seq (seqAnt s)`. For a tag-4 CHAIN node this is
NOT derivable from `ZSeqAnt`: `zSeqAntNext`'s tag-4 clause flags **`0`** (own-flag dropped, `Zsubst:2164`
`zSeqAnt_zK` carries only the premise `iseqMaxTab`-fold), so `ZSeqAnt (zK …)` ⇏ `Seq (seqAnt s)`. (Non-chain
tags 1/2/5/6 DO flag → `seq_seqAnt_of_zSeqAnt` works only for `zTag ≠ 4`.) **Fix = the zSeqAnt tag-4 fold**
(analog of the lap-149 freshFlag fold / lap-146 zIndWff fold): change `zSeqAntNext`'s tag-4 branch from
`if zTag d = 4 then 0 else seqAntSeqFlag (fstIdx d)` to ALWAYS `seqAntSeqFlag (fstIdx d)`, ripple through
`zSeqAntNextDef` σ-clause + `_defined` simp + `zSeqAnt_zK` + the ~6 `ZSeqAnt_zK_*`/`_iRKcCrit` establishing
sites (each re-proves `Seq (seqAnt s)` for the UNCHANGED conclusion `s` from the original chain's strengthened
`ZSeqAnt`) + the orbit sites where chains are first built (genuine `Seq Γ`). Then `Seq (seqAnt s)` falls out
of `hseqant` everywhere, closing the gap with NO threading. Its own focused lap.

### gDef (`exists_sigma1_descending_step` :3128) — SEPARATE obligation (judge): the `𝚺₁` induction yields
`∃ v` (existence), NOT the explicit `𝚺₁` GRAPH gDef needs. Build the constructive single-step reduct
function separately; do NOT expect it from the existence proof. NOT `redLeast`/μ-min (refuted lap-139).

**FORBIDDEN (unchanged):** `red` witnesses; `iord`-RECURSION for the construction (PRWO/Gödel-barred — CODE
induction only, now wired); `redLeast` for gDef; collapsing the repMajor/axMajor split; `iRedDescent` as the
chain descent measure (refuted in-kernel this lap).

## lap 150a — CODE-RECURSION FRAME LANDED: `genReduct_botSucc` by `𝚺₁` structural induction
**Build 🟢 1326. `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` = `[propext, sorryAx, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math
axioms, no drift).** Operator SOLE-OBJECTIVE = M1b-term. Per DIRECTION lap-149's "THEN — the CRUX": the
tag-3 freshFlag was dropped lap 149, so this lap turned to the genuine crux (the general `Γ→⊥`
cut-reduction by strong induction on the derivation CODE) and **built the code-induction skeleton**.

### ✅ DONE (lap 150) — the §14.254 recursion is now a real `𝚺₁` structural induction
The LINCHPIN meta-question ("can the existence-form general reduction even be run by code-induction in
`𝗜𝚺₁`?") is **settled YES**, machine-checked:
- The existence-form motive `P d := …invariants… → ∃ v, ZDerivation v ∧ … ∧ iRedDescent v d` is
  **`𝚺-[1]`-definable** (probed in-kernel, then landed). It is `𝚺₁` precisely because `iRedDescent` is
  `𝚫₁`. New in `InternalZ.lean`: `iRedDescent_iff` (structure → 3-field conjunction) +
  `iRedDescent_definable` instance + **`zDerivation_sigma_induction`** (the `𝚺₁`-motive variant of
  `zDerivation_induction`; same `Construction.induction (Γ := 𝚺)`, `order_induction_sigma` at `m:=1`).
- **`genReduct_botSucc` restructured** to be proven by `zDerivation_sigma_induction` (`Crux2Blueprint`):
  tags ∉{3,4} vacuous (`simp at htag`); tag-3 (`zInd`) PROVEN inline via `ind_reduct_botSucc_of_fresh`;
  tag-4 (`zK`) delegates to the new `genReduct_botSucc_chain`, **supplying the per-premise IH** the
  induction hands back (`(hC (znth ds i) (hmem i hi)).2`). So the §14.254 recursion is now set up with
  its IH in hand — no `iord`-recursion (PRWO/Gödel-barred), recursion on the CODE only.
- Verified axiom-clean: `genReduct_botSucc` / `genReduct_botSucc_chain` / `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` all
  `[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]` (the lone new `sorryAx` is `genReduct_botSucc_chain`).

### ▶ NEXT — prove `genReduct_botSucc_chain` (`Crux2Blueprint`, the ONE remaining general-reduction crux)
A `zK s r ds` chain deriving `Γ→⊥` (`seqSucc s = ⊥`, `Γ = seqAnt s` possibly NONEMPTY), regular/fresh/
seqAnt, with the per-premise IH (each premise `znth ds i`, when a tag-3/4 `Rep` node with the invariants,
already has its descending reduct). Produce the chain's same-end-sequent (`fstIdx v = s`) strictly-`iord`-
descending regular/fresh/seqAnt `ZDerivation` reduct `v`. This is the `Γ→⊥` `ZDerivation`/`iRedDescent`-
valued analog of the WHOLE `∅→⊥` tower (`descent_step_K_hasRedex` + `descent_step_K_noncrit_*`). Attack:
1. **Extract the exit `j0`** from `zKValidF s r ds` (chain validity) — the `isChainInf` first ⊥-exit, with
   threading/rank. Same as `descent_step_K_noncritical:3042` (`zKValidF_of_ZDerivation_zK hZ).1`).
2. **`by_cases` redex pair below `j0`:**
   - YES → the criticality-free principal cut `iRKcCrit (zK s r ds)`. PORT `descent_step_K_hasRedex`
     (`Crux2Blueprint:2346`) to RETURN the `iRedDescent`-bundle (not `icmp (iord …)=0`) and to a
     `ZDerivation` value: `ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_all`/`_neg_botOrbit` are ALREADY `ZDerivation`-valued and
     do NOT need `seqAnt = ∅` (the `hant` is used only to supply `Seq (seqAnt s)=Seq ∅` — replace with
     `Seq Γ` from the chain's own seqAnt validity). The descent half: need an `iRedDescent`-bundle form of
     `iord_descent_iRKcCrit_corr_of_redex`/`_neg_of_redex` (they give the combined `iord` descent; split
     into `idg_le` + `iotil` `icmp=0` + NF — check `RedZKDescent.lean` for the bundle, mirror
     `iRedDescent_iIndReductSeqG_one`).
   - NO → `majorPrem_tag_mem` ⟹ major premise tag ∈ {3,4,5,6}. tags 3/4 → reduce the major premise by
     the **IH** directly; tags 5/6 → identify the `Rep` cut-partner (`majorPrem_zAxAll_cutPartner`/
     `_zAxNeg_cutPartner`, tag 3/4) and reduce IT by the IH. Then REPLACE: PORT `descent_step_K_replace`
     (`Crux2Blueprint:2475`) to a `Γ→⊥` `ZDerivation`/`iRedDescent`-valued analog
     (`ZDerivation_iCritAux_of` + `iord_descent_iCritAux_of_ZDerivation` are `Γ`-agnostic; the only
     `∅→⊥`-specific part of `_replace` is the `ZDerivesEmptyR` wrapping — rebundle as `iRedDescent`).
3. Likely needs a `Γ→⊥` `ZDerivation`-valued `descent_step_K_replace_gen` + a `genReduct_chain_hasRedex`
   leaf; decompose further with disclosed sub-`sorry`s as needed (raising src count = progress).

**FORBIDDEN (unchanged):** `red` witnesses; `iord`-recursion for the general step (CODE-induction ONLY —
now wired); `redLeast`/μ-min for gDef; collapsing the repMajor/axMajor split. The parallel **gDef**
(`exists_sigma1_descending_step`) crux is independent — attack after/alongside.


**Build 🟢 1326. Re-verified in-kernel: headline + `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` + `ZDerivesEmptyR_descent_step` +
`descent_step_K_noncrit_recurse` all `[propext, sorryAx, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms) — no
drift.** Operator SOLE-OBJECTIVE = M1b-term. Crux-2 termination is now reduced to **4 disclosed `sorryAx`
leaves**: (1) tag-3 freshFlag `Crux2Blueprint:2974`; (2) tag-4 K-recursion `descent_step_K_noncrit_repMajor_K`
:2934; (3) tag-5/6 cut-partner `descent_step_K_noncrit_axMajor`:3002; (4) (A) gDef `exists_sigma1_descending_step`
:3125. Leaves (2)+(3) ARE the genuine crux (general `Γ→⊥` cut-reduction); (4) the parallel Σ₁-definability crux;
(1) the LAST tractable leaf. (DIRECTION.md CURRENT DIRECTIVE = lap-149, OUTRANKS this file.)

### ✅ DONE (lap 149) — tag-3 freshFlag DROPPED. `descent_step_K_noncrit_repMajor` tag-3 branch is sorry-free.
Executed the strengthening below. **Twist found:** the real zInd matrix is `IsSemiformula 1` (induction var),
not `IsUFormula`, so `freshFlag_zsubst_eq_zero` (wants `IsUFormula`) doesn't apply to it directly — a level-1
generalization would have been a yak-shave. **Resolved** by carrying the flag with a **dummy `^⊥` matrix**
(`freshFlag (zIndEig d) ⊥ (seqAnt (fstIdx d))`): `ind_reduct_botSucc_of_fresh` consumes ONLY the antecedent
part (`freshFlag_snd`/`_wff`), never the matrix, and on the ⊥-orbit the conclusion formula is `⊥` anyway, so
antecedent-only freshness is the complete (faithful) eigenvariable condition. Reuses `freshFlag` + its
definability, zero new boilerplate. Verified axiom-clean: `ind_reduct_botSucc_of_fresh`/`zFresh_zsubst` =
`[propext, choice, Quot.sound]` (no sorryAx); headline + `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` unchanged 0 math axioms.
**NEXT = the crux below (general `Γ→⊥` code-recursion).**

#### (Historical) the executed ripple — DROP tag-3 freshFlag (`Crux2Blueprint:2974`)
The residual was `have hfreshΓ : freshFlag (π₁ at'') p' (seqAnt s') = 0 := sorry` — the I∀-style eigenvariable
freshness of the `zInd` major premise. `ind_reduct_botSucc_of_fresh` already CONSUMES it; producing it makes
`descent_step_K_noncrit_repMajor`'s tag-3 branch sorry-free. **`zFresh`/`zFreshNext` does not yet carry it for
`zInd` — the fix mirrors the tag-1 I∀ clause** (which DOES carry `freshFlag`, `Zsubst.lean:1671`). It is the
EXACT shape of the lap-146 `zIndWff` membership→shape ripple that DROPPED `descent_step_Ind` — a focused,
definability-dominated ripple, NOT a 64-site cascade (`zFresh` is C-free → `zphi_monotone`/`_strong_finite`
untouched). Concrete steps:
1. **`zFreshNext` body** `Zsubst.lean:1673` — change the tag-3 branch from
   `max (znth s (zIndPrem0 d)) (znth s (zIndPrem1 d))` to
   `max (freshFlag (zIndEig d) (zIndP d) (seqAnt (fstIdx d))) (max (znth s (zIndPrem0 d)) (znth s (zIndPrem1 d)))`.
   (`zIndEig (zInd s at' p d0 d1)=π₁ at'`, `zIndP (zInd …)=p`, both confirmed; `seqAnt (fstIdx (zInd …))=seqAnt s`.)
2. **`zFreshNextDef`** σ-clause `:1683-1684` — mirror the tag-1 σ-block `:1679-1681`: insert
   `!zIndEigDef ea d ∧ !zIndPDef pf d ∧ !fstIdxDef f d ∧ !seqAntDef ga f ∧ !freshFlagDef fl ea pf ga` and
   `!max.dfn` the flag with the prem-fold.
3. **`zFreshNext_defined`** simp set `:1691-1694` — add `zIndEig_defined.iff`, `zIndP_defined.iff`
   (`freshFlag_defined.iff`/`fstIdx_defined.iff`/`seqAnt_defined.iff` already present). Re-run the by_cases h3 leg.
4. **`zFresh_zInd`** simp `:1812` — restate as the new `max freshFlag (max prem0 prem1)`.
5. **`zFresh_zsubst`** tag-3 case `:1947-1955` — mirror the tag-1 case `:1935-1941`: the new freshFlag component
   is preserved by closed-numeral subst via `freshFlag_zsubst_eq_zero` + `seqAnt_fvSubstSeqt`; add the trivial
   extractor `freshFlag_eq_zero_of_zfresh_zInd` (mirror `:1872` `freshFlag_eq_zero_of_zfresh_zIall`).
6. **Re-project the 4 max-extraction sites** that read `ZFresh d0/d1` off `zFresh_zInd`
   (`Crux2Blueprint:2657/2660/2801/2804`, + `Zsubst:2894`) — they now need one extra `le_max_right` to skip the
   new outer freshFlag slot before the inner `le_max_left/right`.
7. **Discharge `:2974`** — from `hfreshm : ZFresh (znth ds (majorIdx …))` (= `zFresh (zInd s' at'' p' d0' d1')=0`,
   which now carries `freshFlag (π₁ at'') p' (seqAnt s')` in its outer `max`): `le_max_left` + `nonpos_iff_eq_zero`
   + `fstIdx_zInd`. **tag-3 repMajor goes sorry-free.**

### ✅ DONE (lap 149, same lap) — general-reduction interface `genReduct_botSucc` LANDED + tag-3 PROVEN
Built the §14.254 crux interface as a single named lemma (`Crux2Blueprint`, replaces the lap-148 `_K` leaf):
```
lemma genReduct_botSucc {d} (hZ : ZDerivation d) (hreg : ZRegular d) (hfresh : ZFresh d)
    (hseqant : ZSeqAnt d) (hsucc : seqSucc (fstIdx d) = ⊥) (htag : zTag d = 3 ∨ zTag d = 4) :
    ∃ v, ZDerivation v ∧ ZRegular v ∧ ZFresh v ∧ ZSeqAnt v ∧ fstIdx v = fstIdx d ∧ iRedDescent v d
```
**tag-3 (zInd) PROVEN** (consumes `ind_reduct_botSucc_of_fresh` + the freshness from the strengthened `zFresh`);
**tag-4 (zK) = the ONE remaining crux sorry** (`Crux2Blueprint:2961`). `descent_step_K_noncrit_repMajor` now
routes BOTH tags uniformly through it + `descent_step_K_replace` (the separate `_K` leaf is subsumed). Verified
axiom-clean: headline + `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` + `descent_step_K_noncrit_repMajor` =
`[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms, no drift). Build 🟢 1326.

### ▶ NEXT — close `genReduct_botSucc` tag-4 (zK): the general `Γ→⊥` chain reduction by structural/code induction
The single remaining general-reduction crux. `d` is a `zK s' r' ds'` deriving `Γ→⊥`. Produce its same-end-sequent
strictly-`iord`-descending reduct `v` with `iRedDescent v d`. This is `descent_step_K_majorIdx` GENERALIZED off
`∅→⊥` to `Γ→⊥` and returning a `ZDerivation` reduct (not a `ZDerivesEmptyR`). Attack path:
1. **Prove it by `zDerivation_induction`** (structural induction on the derivation CODE — the §14.254 recursion;
   the IH gives `genReduct_botSucc` for each structurally-smaller premise). This is the `𝗜𝚺₁`-available
   recursion (NOT `iord`-recursion, PRWO/Gödel-barred). `zDerivation_induction` is the eliminator used in
   `zFresh_zsubst` (`Zsubst.lean`).
2. The zK case dispatches on redex/no-redex below the chain exit (mirror `descent_step_K_majorIdx`'s
   critical/non-critical split, but `Γ→⊥` and `ZDerivation`-valued): redex → the `iRKcCrit` principal cut
   (`descent_step_K_hasRedex`-style, criticality-free); no-redex → recurse into the major premise / cut-partner
   via the IH (tags 3/4 → `genReduct_botSucc` IH; tags 5/6 → cut-partner identification).
3. The descent machinery (`descent_step_K_replace`, `ind_reduct_botSucc_of_fresh`, the banked `iCritAux`
   invariants) is `ZDerivesEmptyR`-specific — likely needs `Γ→⊥` (`ZDerivation`-valued) analogs. Assess what
   generalizes vs what's new; decompose further if needed (more disclosed sub-`sorry`s is fine).
4. **gDef** (`Crux2Blueprint:3128`) is the parallel Σ₁-definability crux — independent; attack after or alongside.

**FORBIDDEN:** `red` witnesses; `iord`-recursion for the general step (structural/code induction ONLY);
`redLeast`/μ-min for gDef (refuted lap-139); collapsing the repMajor/axMajor §14.254a/b split.

## lap 148 — §14.254 REPLACE plumbing banked + no-redex residual re-split, judge-C3-aligned
**Build 🟢 1326. Headline `[propext, sorryAx, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms) — no drift.**
Operator SOLE-OBJECTIVE = M1b-term. This lap acted on the host-flagged judge review
(`E-2026-06-26-JUDGE-codex-review.md`, point **C3** — converged with Codex): **prove the two no-redex
major-premise cases SEPARATELY first + a shared replace tool; do NOT write `descent_step_general` blind.**

### What this lap DID
1. **Source-grounded the no-redex dichotomy in Buchholz §14.25** (`scratchpad/buchholz-gentzen.txt:262-490`).
   The decisive reads:
   - **§14.25**: the major premise is NEVER in endform — GENERAL argument (`Γⱼ ⊆ Θ` + `Aⱼ ≈ ⊥`: if the major
     premise were endform, the endsequent would be too) — valid for ANY `Γ`, not just `∅`. So the recursion
     into a sub-premise stays reducible.
   - **has-redex = §14.253** principal cut (PROVEN lap-147, `descent_step_K_hasRedex`).
   - **no-redex splits into §14.254a + §14.254b**, BOTH of which "replace a `Rep` premise with its
     same-end-sequent reduct": **14.254a** (`tp(dₘ)=Rep`) replaces the major premise `dₘ`; **14.254b**
     (`tp(dₘ)=Lₖ_V`, `V∉Θ`) replaces the upstream cut-partner `i′` — which, in the NO-redex case, is NOT an
     R-intro (else `⟪i′,m⟫` is a redex `≤ j0`), so `tp(d_{i′})=Rep`. **CORRECTION vs lap-147's PENDING note:**
     no-redex axMajor is §14.254b (reduce the Rep partner), NOT §14.253 (principal cut — that IS the has-redex
     case, already proven). The two cases provably share ONE motive (judge C3 gate SATISFIED).
2. **Banked the shared replace plumbing `descent_step_K_replace`** (`Crux2Blueprint:2475`, axiom-clean
   `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`): given a chain `zK s r ds` and ANY premise `i` with a same-end-sequent
   (`fstIdx v = fstIdx (znth ds i)`) strictly-`iord`-descending regular/fresh/seqAnt `ZDerivation` reduct `v`,
   `zK s r (seqUpdate ds i v)` is a strictly-descending `ZDerivesEmptyR`. Pure assembly over banked
   `ZDerivation_iCritAux_of` (validity, `zKValidF_seqUpdate`) + `iord_descent_iCritAux_of_ZDerivation` (the
   N1-IH descent) + `ZRegular/ZFresh/ZSeqAnt_zK_of_seqUpdate`; the reduct's wff side-conditions discharge
   uniformly from `ZDerivation v` (`iperm_tp_fstIdx_of_ZDerivation` + `zKValidF_leafconds_of_ZDerivation`).
   This is the §14.254 `d[0] = Kʳ_Θ(i ∕ dᵢ[0])` step, off `red`, off criticality.
3. **Re-split `descent_step_K_noncrit_recurse`** (lap-147 had collapsed it to ONE sorry with a docstring that
   wrongly claimed "all cases replace the major premise" — false for the tag-5/6 `red`-FIXPOINT L-axioms,
   lap-130 finding `InternalZ:9281`) into the faithful §14.254a/b leaves, restoring the judge-C2 three-leaf
   M1b path `{repMajor, axMajor, gDef}`:
   - `descent_step_K_noncrit_repMajor` (`Crux2Blueprint:2527`, tags 3/4) — §14.254a, replace the major premise.
   - `descent_step_K_noncrit_axMajor` (`Crux2Blueprint:2545`, tags 5/6) — §14.254b, replace the Rep cut-partner.
   - dispatcher `descent_step_K_noncrit_recurse` now sorry-FREE (routes via `majorPrem_tag_mem`).

### ⚠️ WHY no sorry dropped — both leaves bottom out in the GENERAL `Γ→⊥` reduction (multi-lap, honest)
Each leaf's lone residual is now PRECISE: produce the `Rep`-reduct of a structurally-smaller premise (`dₘ` for
repMajor, `d_{i′}` for axMajor) deriving `Γ′→⊥` with `Γ′` possibly NONEMPTY. That is the GENERAL reduction,
closure via strong induction on the derivation CODE (Buchholz Thm 2.1; NOT `iord`-recursion — PRWO/Gödel-barred).
All the SURROUNDING plumbing (replace → ZDerivesEmptyR + descent) is now discharged by `descent_step_K_replace`.

### CONTINUATION (same lap, governor-resumed) — tag-3 repMajor PROVEN modulo eigenvariable freshness
Built the §14.254a Ind-reduct machinery (both axiom-clean `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`) and WIRED tag-3:
- **`iRedDescent_iIndReductSeqG_one`** (`Crux2Blueprint`) — the `iRedDescent` BUNDLE (`idg≤`, `õ≺`, NF) form of
  the k=1 Ind reduct descent (the interface `descent_step_K_replace` consumes), from the banked
  `idg_zK_iIndReduct` (samedeg) + `icmp_iotil_iIndReduct` + the `_one_eq` transfers.
- **`ind_reduct_botSucc_of_fresh`** (`Crux2Blueprint`) — the `ZDerivation`-valued `Γₘ→⊥` Ind reduct: a
  `zInd s at' p d0 d1` deriving `Γₘ→⊥` (`Γₘ`=`seqAnt s` possibly nonempty), regular/fresh/seqAnt, with
  eigenvariable freshness `freshFlag (π₁ at') p Γₘ = 0`, has its k=1 reduct `zK s (irk p) ⟨d0,d1[a:=0]⟩` as a
  SAME-end-sequent (`fstIdx=s`) strictly-descending regular/fresh/seqAnt `ZDerivation`. The generalization of
  lap-146 `descent_step_Ind` off `Γ=∅`: the freshness collapses the reduct step-premise antecedent
  `fvSubstSeq a 0 (seqCons Γₘ ⊥) = seqCons Γₘ ⊥` (telescope threads `Γₘ`) + gives `Γₘ` wff (`freshFlag_wff`).
- **`descent_step_K_noncrit_repMajor`** now SPLIT: tag-3 (`zInd`) **PROVEN** inline via
  `ind_reduct_botSucc_of_fresh` + `descent_step_K_replace` at `i=majorIdx`, modulo the LONE residual sorry
  `freshFlag (π₁ at'') p' (seqAnt s') = 0`; tag-4 → `descent_step_K_noncrit_repMajor_K` (the `zK` recursion).
  (Required a block-move of the no-redex residual chain `[repMajor … majorIdx]` to AFTER the Ind machinery.)

### THE next DROP (hardest-first) — strengthen `zFreshNext` tag-3 to carry the eigenvariable freshFlag
The tag-3 residual `freshFlag (π₁ at') p Γₘ = 0` is the I∀-style eigenvariable condition. `zFresh_zInd`
(`Zsubst:1812`) = `max (zFresh d0) (zFresh d1)` does NOT carry it (unlike `zFresh_zIall` =
`max (freshFlag a p (seqAnt s)) (zFresh d0)`). Principled fix = add `freshFlag (zIndEig d) (zIndP d)
(seqAnt (fstIdx d))` to `zFreshNext`'s tag-3 branch (`Zsubst:1673`), mirroring tag-1. Ripple (focused, NOT a
ZPhi cascade — `zFresh` is C-free; additive since nothing yet BUILDS a `zInd`'s `ZFresh` except the reduct
which WANTS it): (a) `zFreshNext` def :1673; (b) `zFreshNextDef` σ tag-3 conjunct :1683 (mirror tag-1 :1679);
(c) `zFreshNext_defined` tag-3 simp case :1700; (d) `zFresh_zInd` simp :1812; (e) `zFresh_zsubst` Ind case
(via `freshFlag_zsubst_eq_zero`, banked); (f) update `descent_step_Ind`/`ind_reduct_botSucc_of_fresh`
extractions (`hfr0`/`hfr1` shift one `le_max`), then DERIVE `hfreshΓ` from `ZFresh (zInd …)` in repMajor → tag-3
DROPS. Risk = the σ-formula/`_defined` simp (definability), `maxHeartbeats` already 1000000. (tag-4 `zK` major
needs the recursion proper / splice; axMajor needs the cut-partner-Rep dichotomy via `majorPrem_*_cutPartner`.)

## lap 147 — §5.2 WIRED to Buchholz §14.25: `descent_step_K_noncritical` decomposed on MAJOR-premise tag
**Build 🟢 1326. Headline `[propext, sorryAx, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms) — no drift.**
ONE commit (major-premise dispatch wiring). Operator SOLE-OBJECTIVE = M1b-term (terminate crux-2). The
live `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` path's first remaining sorry is `descent_step_K_noncritical` (the §5.2
non-critical K-step). This lap WIRED the banked-but-unused lap-129/130 major-premise machinery into it.

### What this lap DID — wire `majorIdx`, decompose along Buchholz §14.25 (no drop, a sharpening)
`descent_step_K_noncritical` (`Crux2Blueprint:2190`) is now a **sorry-FREE dispatcher** on the FAITHFUL
major premise (first `⊥`-exit, `majorIdx`), replacing the lap-129 stall-prone `permIdx` framing. Via
`majorPrem_tag_mem` (major premise tag ∈ {3,4,5,6}) it routes to two named sub-sorries:
- **`descent_step_K_noncrit_repMajor`** (`:2163`, tag 3/4, Buchholz §14.254) — `Rep` major premise
  (`zInd`/sub-`zK`), reduced by REPLACE with its own reduct.
- **`descent_step_K_noncrit_axMajor`** (`:2174`, tag 5/6, Buchholz §14.253 principal case) — L-axiom major
  premise (`zAxAll`/`zAxNeg`), reduced by the principal CUT vs the upstream R-partner (cut-partner pinned by
  `majorPrem_zAxAll_cutPartner`/`_zAxNeg_cutPartner`).
This dissolves the lap-129 `permIdx` atom/`Ax¹` STALL in the live path (the major premise is provably never a
leaf, `majorIdx_botOrbit_reducible`) and aligns the obligation with Buchholz's actual two-case reduction.

### ⚠️ WHY no drop this lap — both sub-cases bottom out in the GENERAL reduction (multi-lap, honest block)
Verified IN-KERNEL during the feasibility pass:
- **repMajor**: the major premise derives `Γₘ→⊥` with `Γₘ ⊆ {A₀…A_{m−1}}` (`isChainInf` threading), **possibly
  NONEMPTY** — so reducing it is the GENERAL Z-derivation reduction, NOT the ⊥-orbit special case that
  `descent_step_Ind`/`_K_critical` exploited (those needed `Γ = ∅` for the telescope/antecedent collapse).
- **axMajor**: the critical machinery does NOT extend for free. `redZKReady_of_zKValid`/`chainInf_redexI_data`
  find the redex via `inference_critical_pair_of_chain`, which CONSUMES criticality (`hnperm`), absent here.
  Worse, the cut-partner `i′` need only have SUCCEDENT `^∀p` (`majorPrem_*_cutPartner`), NOT be a direct
  R-intro — it can itself be a chain, so no redex pair need exist until `i′` is reduced. Also recursive.
- `inegF p ≠ ^⊥` always (`inegF_ne_falsum`) ⟹ on `∅→⊥` a permissible premise is EXACTLY an `isymRep` node
  (`zInd`/`zK`/`zAtom`/`zAx1`), confirming non-critical = "has an `isymRep` premise" (lap-129 picture exact).

### ✅ ALSO this lap — DECOUPLED the `iRKcCrit` engine from CRITICALITY (commit 2/2)
Verified in-kernel that `iRKcCrit` soundness (`ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_all`/`_neg_botOrbit`), descent
(`iord_descent_iRcrit_of_redex` :5313), and invariants (`ZRegular/ZFresh/ZSeqAnt_iRKcCrit`) are ALL
criticality-free GIVEN the redex data — criticality enters ONLY at `isRedexPair_redexCode_of_zKValid` →
`inference_critical_pair_of_chain` (to prove a redex exists). Landed the criticality-free replacements
(`Crux2Blueprint`, after `descent_step_K_critical`): `isRedexPair_redexCode_of_exists`,
`redexI_lt_of_redexPair` (pair-monotone bound `redexI<j0` from any in-region redex pair),
`redZKReady_of_zKValidF_exists` (the redZKReady ∀/¬ disjunction from `zKValidF`+redex-existence, no crit).

### ✅✅ DONE this lap — `descent_step_K_hasRedex` ASSEMBLED + the has-redex half of §5.2 PROVEN
`descent_step_K_hasRedex` (`Crux2Blueprint:2346`) is sorry-free: regular `∅→⊥` chain + `isChainInf` exit data +
ANY in-region redex pair `⟪i0,j1⟫` (`i0<j1≤j0`) ⟹ genuine `iRKcCrit` reduct strictly-`iord`-descends, NO
`red`/criticality. Wired all decoupling pieces (finders + `ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_all`/`_neg_botOrbit` +
`iord_descent_iRKcCrit_corr_of_redex`/`_neg_of_redex` + no-`_of_zK` invariants). `descent_step_K_noncritical`
is now a has-redex/no-redex dispatcher (`:2487`): extract exit `j0` from `zKValidF`, `by_cases` redex-below-`j0`
→ `hasRedex` (PROVEN) / `descent_step_K_noncrit_recurse` (residual). The §14.253 principal cut is DISCHARGED
for non-critical chains; only the §14.254 general reduction remains.

### 🎯 THE ONE remaining §5.2 sorry — `descent_step_K_noncrit_recurse` (`Crux2Blueprint:2470`)
No redex below the exit ⟹ (`majorPrem_tag_mem`) the major premise is a `Rep` node (`zInd`/sub-`zK`, §14.254) or
a tag-5/6 L-axiom with a chain cut-partner — all REDUCE THE MAJOR PREMISE (a `Γₘ→⊥` derivation, `Γₘ` possibly
nonempty) = the GENERAL `Γ→⊥` reduction. **Closure = `descent_step_general` by STRUCTURAL induction** (NOT
`iord`-recursion — that is PRWO, Gödel-barred in 𝗜𝚺₁; structural/Σ₁ induction on the derivation code is fine),
i.e. Buchholz Theorem 2.1 / Corollary 2.1:
  `descent_step_general : regular ZDerivation of Γ→⊥, not in endform ⟹ ∃ same-sequent reduct, iord-descending`.
Then `recurse` reduces the major premise by the IH (smaller derivation), REPLACES it (`isChainInf_congr` keeps
validity, `iord_descent_red_zK_replace_eq` :363 banked descent). Per-tag reducts: `zInd`→Ind unfolding
(generalize `descent_step_Ind` off `Γ=∅`); `zK`→recursion/splice (`iord_descent_red_zK_chain_*` banked);
`zAxAll`/`zAxNeg` with redex→`hasRedex`; atoms/`Ax1`→endform/§5. Effectively rebuilds the reduction engine
correctly (the broken `red`'s replacement).

### 🎯 DEEPER (the full drop) — generalize the descent step to `Γ→⊥`, structural-induct
The natural closure is **Buchholz Theorem 2.1 / Corollary 2.1** as ONE generalized lemma proved by strong
`iord`-induction (each premise has strictly smaller `iord`):

  `descent_step_general` : regular `ZDerivation` of `Γ→⊥`, NOT in endform ⟹ ∃ same-sequent reduct `d'` with
  `icmp (iord d') (iord d) = 0`.

Then `repMajor`/`axMajor` (hence `descent_step_K_noncritical`) fall out: reduce the major premise by the IH
(smaller `iord`), REPLACE it in the chain (`isChainInf_congr` keeps validity, `iord_descent_red_zK_replace_eq`
gives descent). The per-tag reducts of `descent_step_general`: `zK`→this lemma (recursion/splice,
`iord_descent_red_zK_chain_*` banked); `zInd`→Ind unfolding (`iIndReductSeqG`, generalize the lap-145/146
`descent_step_Ind` soundness off `Γ=∅`); `zAxAll`/`zAxNeg`→principal cut (`iRKcCrit`, supply `redexI < j₀`
from the cut-partner redex via the `chainInf_redexI_data` pair-monotone bound, BYPASSING criticality);
`zAtom`/`zAx1`→endform or §5 atomic. The DESCENT halves are all banked (`RedZKDescent.lean`); the genuine
work is the per-tag SOUNDNESS at nonempty `Γ`. SMALLER first step worth a lap: the `redexI < j₀`-from-redex
bound (decouple `chainInf_redexI_data` from criticality) — the linchpin for both `axMajor` and the embedding.

## lap 146 — REVIEW + `zIndWff` strengthening + **`descent_step_Ind` DROPPED** (axiom-clean, off red)
**Build 🟢 1326. Headline `[propext, sorryAx, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms) — no drift.**
FOUR commits: review (`5d77bd5`) + `zIndWff` strengthening (`a2b2a3a`) + assembly plan (`aca7536`) +
**`descent_step_Ind` DROPPED** (`59b339b`, `#print axioms = [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`).

### ✅✅ DONE this lap — `descent_step_Ind` PROVEN (the Ind-root soundness/descent)
The Ind-root branch of `ZDerivesEmptyR_descent_step` is now fully proven AND off `red`. Assembly (mirroring
`descent_step_K_critical_all`): witness `zK s (irk ⊥) (iIndReductSeqG d0 d1 (π₁ at') 1)`; `p=⊥` collapses the
telescope; the strengthened `zIndWff` supplies the exact antecedent shape; `zKValidF` via
`isChainInf_telescope` + `iperm_tp_fstIdx_of_ZDerivation` + NEW `zKValidF_leafconds_of_ZDerivation` (InternalZ,
banked axiom-clean — extracts the tag-{1,2,5,6} `IsUFormula` obligations from a premise's `ZPhi` data);
invariants via the `_zK_of` folds + `*_zsubst` preservation; descent = banked `iord_descent_iIndReductSeqG_one`.

### 🎯 LIVE-PATH SORRIES NOW (2 left on `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty`)
1. **`descent_step_K_noncritical`** (`Crux2Blueprint:2139`) — Buchholz §3.2 case 5.2 atomic reduction (the
   deepest remaining cut-elimination content; resolves the lap-129 `red`-fixpoint stall via Lemma 5.2). Its
   Ind-premise sub-case may now reuse the `iIndReductSeqG` + `zKValidF_leafconds_of_ZDerivation` machinery.
2. **(A) `exists_sigma1_descending_step`** (`Crux2Blueprint:2457`) — `gDef` Σ₁-Semisentence packaging
   (Foundation-definability; μ-route refuted lap-139; needs primrec witness bound OR deterministic reduct).

---
### (historical, this lap) the `zIndWff` membership→shape ripple — the enabler of the drop

### ✅ DONE this lap — `zIndWff` membership→shape ripple (commit `a2b2a3a`)
New `zIndWff` step clause (`InternalZ:1684`): `Seq (seqAnt (fstIdx d)) ∧ seqAnt (fstIdx prem1) =
seqCons (seqAnt (fstIdx d)) (substs1 (qqFvar (eig)) p) ∧ <succ>` (Seq bundled exactly like lap-118
`zInegAntWff`, so the shape is self-preserving under eigensubst via `fvSubstSeq_seqCons`). Edits: body +
`zIndWffDef` σ/π (`seqConsDef`+`seqDef`, `sas` already bound) + `zIndWff_defined` simp (`seqCons_defined.iff`,
`seq_defined.iff`) + `zsubst` preservation (`Zsubst` zInd case: new `Seq` goal `fvSubstSeq_seq` + shape via
`fvSubstSeq_seqCons h2seq`) + triple-destructure fixes (`Crux2Blueprint:146` `⟨_,_,h0succ⟩`, `:329`
`⟨_,_,h1succ⟩`). Build green, no axiom drift, live sorries unchanged.

### 🎯 NEXT (the DROP) — assemble `descent_step_Ind` (`Crux2Blueprint:2262`) from the now-available shape
Witness = `zK s (irk p) (iIndReductSeqG d0 d1 (π₁ at') 1)` (= `⟨d0, d1[a:=0]⟩`). Need `ZDerivesEmptyR` of it +
`icmp (iord …) (iord (zInd …)) = 0`. The DESCENT is banked (`iord_descent_iIndReductSeqG_one`). For
soundness: from `zDerivation_zInd_inv hZ` get `ZDerivation d0`, `ZDerivation d1`, `zIndWff (zInd …)`; the
strengthened `zIndWff` now yields `Seq (seqAnt s)` + `seqAnt(fstIdx d1) = seqCons (seqAnt s) (F(a))`. On the
⊥-orbit `seqAnt s = ∅`, `p = ⊥` (`eq_falsum_of_substs1_falsum` via `hsucc : seqSucc s = ⊥` + the zIndWff concl
clause) ⟹ `F(a) = substs1 _ ⊥ = ⊥` ⟹ `seqAnt(fstIdx d1) = seqCons ∅ ⊥ = {⊥}`, and `seqAnt(fstIdx (d1[a:=0])) =
{⊥}` too (subst-invariant on `⊥`). Then the chain `⟨d0, d1[a:=0]⟩` threads (`isChainInf_telescope` :169 +
`chainAnt_/chainAsucc_iIndReductSeqG_*` :287-315), `ZDerivesEmptyR` via `zDerivation_zK_intro` + premise
`ZDerivation`s (`ZDerivation_zsubst` with `maxEigen d1 < π₁ at'` from `ZRegular (zInd …)`) + the reduct
invariants `ZRegular/ZFresh/ZSeqAnt` (premise-hereditary). All structural building blocks VERIFIED to exist
(lap 146): `zDerivation_zK_intro` (InternalZ:5772, takes `zKValidF` — NO criticality), `isChainInf_telescope`
(:169), `iperm_tp_fstIdx_of_ZDerivation` (:5784, uniform iperm), `ZRegular_zK_of_premises` (Zsubst:2423),
`zfresh_zK_of` (:1859), `zSeqAnt_zK_of` (:2195); zsubst-preserves-invariants `zReg_zsubst` (:1480, =zReg d),
`zFresh_zsubst` (:1925, needs `numeral n`), `zSeqAnt_zsubst` (:2214, =0); premise extraction via `zReg_zInd`/
`zFresh_zInd`/`zSeqAnt_zInd` simp + `ltFlag_eq_zero_iff` (:1221) for `maxEigen d1 < π₁ at'`; descent
`iord_descent_iIndReductSeqG_one` (banked).
⚠️ **THE one concrete uncertainty for the assembly** = building `zKValidF` for a FRESH chain: `zKValidF`
(InternalZ:1415) = `isChainInf ∧ (∀ premise, iperm) ∧ (tag-{1,2,5,6} ⟹ IsUFormula (zIallF/zInegF/zAxAllF/
zAxNegF))`. iperm is uniform (`iperm_tp_fstIdx_of_ZDerivation`), but there is **no `zKValidF_of_premises`
packaging** — the 4 `IsUFormula` side-conditions need either a NEW uniform lemma
`zKValidF_leafconds_of_ZDerivation : ZDerivation d → (zTag d = 1 → IsUFormula (zIallF d)) ∧ … ` (extract from
each premise's Wff — d0 + d1[a:=0], both ZDerivations) OR per-premise case work. **NEXT-LAP step 1 = prove
that extraction lemma**, then the `zKValidF` + the rest of the assembly is mechanical (telescope collapses on
the ⊥-orbit: all antecedents `{⊥}`, succedents `⊥`, exit `j0=1` at `⊥`; `substs1 _ ⊥ = ⊥` via the `substs_*`
family). If it stays long, decompose `descent_step_Ind` into a named `zKValidF (iIndReductSeqG …)` sub-sorry +
the (provable) ZRegular/ZFresh/ZSeqAnt/descent wrapper, dropping the wrapper around the one hard sub-sorry.

### Review findings (what makes the direction SOUND — kept for provenance)

### Live-path inventory (the ONLY sorries reachable from `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty`)
`false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` (:2412, sorry-free) → `prwo_forbids_existence_descent` → `exists_sigma1_descent_of_step`
→ {**(A) `exists_sigma1_descending_step`** :2327 — `gDef` Σ₁-Semisentence packaging} + `ZDerivesEmptyR_descent_step`
(:2270, sorry-free dispatch) → {**`descent_step_Ind`** :2262} + `descent_step_K_majorIdx` (sorry-free) →
{`descent_step_K_critical` (sorry-free, ∀+¬ both off `red`), **`descent_step_K_noncritical`** :2139 (Buchholz §5.2)}.
So exactly THREE live sorries: `descent_step_Ind`, `descent_step_K_noncritical`, (A) `gDef`. All genuine, none
generational, NONE routing through `red`/`redSoundGen`/the kernel-FALSE :80/:1108 chain (those are now off-path).

### Review findings (what makes the lap-145 direction SOUND, not a stale-obstruction repeat)
1. **The gap is REAL.** `zIndWff` (`InternalZ:1681`): base clause :1682 is `seqAnt(fstIdx prem0) = seqAnt(fstIdx d)`
   (an EQUATION); step clause :1684 is `inAnt (F(a)) (seqAnt(fstIdx prem1))` (MEMBERSHIP). Genuine asymmetry —
   contrast the lap-130/142 "obstruction was STALE (disjunct already carried it)" misfires; this one is real.
2. **The strengthening is REQUIRED, not convenient.** Membership-only admits *unsound* Ind nodes: a lax
   `d1 ⊢ {⊥,X}→⊥` (valid, `⊥∈`ant) leaks stray `X` past the Ind rule, so the conclusion `Γ→F(t)` does NOT
   actually follow. So strengthening fixes a latent SOUNDNESS gap in the Z-system AND is more faithful to
   Buchholz (`buchholz-gentzen.txt:140-152`, step premise `F(a),Γ→F(Sa)`) — it cannot over-strengthen.
3. **Cheaper reframes REFUTED.** (a) `ZSeqAnt d := zSeqAnt d = 0` only flags sequence-wellformedness
   (`Seq (seqAnt …)`), NOT antecedent content → gives no shape. (b) The `zIndWff` docstring's "strengthen body
   without re-running the ZPhi cascade" is over-optimistic: `zIndWff` IS a conjunct of the `zPhi` Ind disjunct
   (`InternalZ:5399, 5451`), so its `𝚫₁`-Def changes. BUT `zIndWff` is C-free → `zphi_monotone`/`_strong_finite`
   are untouched; the ripple is definability-dominated, NOT a 64-site cascade.

### NEXT-ATTACK (hardest-first, EXECUTE) — the focused `zIndWff` step-clause→shape ripple ⟹ DROPS `descent_step_Ind`
Replace the step clause (`InternalZ.lean:1684`) MEMBERSHIP with SHAPE
**`seqAnt (fstIdx (zIndPrem1 d)) = seqCons (seqAnt (fstIdx d)) (substs1 ℒₒᵣ (qqFvar (zIndEig d)) (zIndP d))`**
(antecedent EXACTLY `Γ, F(a)`; `seqCons Γ (F(a))`, avoids the `seqAddAnt` succedent mismatch since seqAddAnt
operates on full sequents whereas we only constrain the antecedent sequence). Concrete edit list:
1. **`zIndWff` body** :1684 — swap the `inAnt …` conjunct for the `seqAnt … = seqCons … (substs1 …)` equation.
2. **`zIndWffDef`** σ (:1704) + π (:1718) — replace the `∃ subfa, substs1 subfa fa p ∧ inAnt subfa sa1` clause
   with `∃ subfa, substs1 subfa fa p ∧ ∃ sc, !seqConsDef sc sas subfa ∧ sa1 = sc` (σ) / the ∀-form (π). `sas`
   (= `seqAnt(fstIdx d)`) is ALREADY bound at :1700/:1714. `seqConsDef` exists; `seqAddAntDef`:6318 is the
   sequent-level alternative if needed. ⚠️ `seqCons`'s arg order is `seqCons <seq> <elt>` → `seqCons sas subfa`.
3. **`zIndWff_defined`** :1725 — add `seqCons_defined.iff` to BOTH simp sets (σ and π halves).
4. **`zsubst` preservation** `Zsubst.lean:3595/3604` — re-establish the new equation under substitution
   (`seqAnt`/`seqCons` commute with `zsubst`; the F(a) term substitutes; ZFresh gives eigenvar ≠ subst var).
5. **Assemble `descent_step_Ind`** (`Crux2Blueprint:2262`): from `zDerivation_zInd_inv` (now yielding the shape) +
   `p = ⊥` (`eq_falsum_of_substs1_falsum`) get `seqAnt(fstIdx d1) = seqCons ∅ ⊥ = {⊥}`; chain `⟨d0, d1[a:=0]⟩`
   threads (`isChainInf_telescope`), soundness via `zDerivation_zK_intro` + premise `ZDerivation`s
   (`ZDerivation_zsubst`, `maxEigen d1 < a` from `ZRegular`); descent = banked `iord_descent_iIndReductSeqG_one`.
6. **Build green.** If it surfaces a LIVE constructor of a `zInd` ZDerivation beyond `zsubst`, discharge the new
   shape there too — but M4/embedding isn't wired, so expect only the `zsubst` site.
Risk: like the lap-118 `zAxNeg` ripple this may span 1-2 laps (shape mismatches in the Def σ/π or the zsubst
commute). If stuck >3 honest attempts on any sub-step, leave `descent_step_Ind` sorry'd + record the exact
sub-step here. THEN (separate laps): `descent_step_K_noncritical` (§5.2 atomic reduct), then (A) `gDef`.

---

## lap 145 — `descent_step_Ind` cracked: `k=⟦t⟧` blocker DISSOLVED, descent PROVEN, real blocker = `zIndWff` antecedent gap
**Build 🟢 1326. Headline `[propext, sorryAx, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms).** Two NEW
banked lemmas, both axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`. `descent_step_Ind` stays a named
sorry but is now FULLY decomposed — only its soundness remains, behind a precisely-identified `zIndWff` gap.

### THE three advances on the hardest-first leaf `descent_step_Ind`
1. **`k = ⟦t⟧` blocker DISSOLVED** (`eq_falsum_of_substs1_falsum`). ⊥-orbit ⟹ `substs1 t p = ⊥` ⟹ **`p = ⊥`**
   (subst preserves top connective; `^⊥` is the only constructor mapping to `^⊥`, via `IsSemiformula.case_iff`
   + the 8 `substs_*` simp lemmas). So every reduct premise has succedent `⊥` for ANY `k` — the lap-144 "lone
   genuine prerequisite" (internal term-eval `k=⟦t⟧`) was a phantom. Witness pinned to **`k = 1`**.
2. **DESCENT half DONE** (`iord_descent_iIndReductSeqG_one`). `icmp (iord (zK s (irk p) (iIndReductSeqG d0 d1
   (π₁ at') 1))) (iord (zInd …)) = 0`. The genuine `k=1` reduct's `iord` = the ordinal shadow `iIndReductSeq
   d0 d1 1 = ⟨d1,d0⟩`'s (both 2-element, same premise-ordinal multiset; `idg/iotil` substitution-invariant) via
   a SINGLE `inadd`/`max` commute → banked `iord_descent_iIndReduct` transfers. **`k=1` chosen precisely to
   avoid `inadd_assoc`** (repo lacks it for general `k`; the `red` Ind reduct is the 2-element shadow for the
   same reason). Helpers: `iIndReductSeqG_one`, `idg_/iotil_zK_iIndReductSeqG_one_eq` (private).

### THE finding — soundness is blocked by a `zIndWff` faithfulness GAP (the real obstruction)
`ZDerivesEmptyR (zK s (irk p) (iIndReductSeqG d0 d1 (π₁ at') 1))` needs `⟨d0, d1[a:=0]⟩` to thread
(`isChainInf`): `seqAnt(fstIdx d1) ⊆ {⊥}` (Γ=∅, all succedents ⊥). But `zIndWff` gives only `inAnt (F(a))
(seqAnt(fstIdx d1))` — **MEMBERSHIP, not shape**. A lax Ind node can have `d1` = a `zAtom` deriving `{⊥,X}→⊥`
(valid: `⊥∈`antecedent), whose reduct is NOT a valid chain ⟹ **the soundness goal is genuinely FALSE for lax
nodes** (do NOT flat-sorry it). The lap-144 plan silently assumed the antecedent shape `zIndWff` never gave.

### NEXT-ATTACK (hardest-first) — strengthen `zIndWff` (lap-115/118-style faithfulness ripple)
Pin the step clause to **`seqAnt(fstIdx d1) = seqAddAnt (F(a)) (seqAnt s)`** (Buchholz Ind: step antecedent
EXACTLY `Γ,F(a)`). Ripple: ZPhi Ind disjunct + `zphi_monotone`/`_strong_finite`/`zphi_iff`/`zblueprint` σ+π/
`zPhi_definable` + `rcases zDerivation_iff.mp` sites + `zIndWff`/`zDerivation_zInd_inv`. After it: `seqAnt(fstIdx
d1) = {⊥}`, telescope `hstep` holds, soundness closes (`zDerivation_zK_intro` + `isChainInf_telescope` + premise
`ZDerivation`s via `ZDerivation_zsubst` [needs `maxEigen d1 < π₁ at'` from `ZRegular`] + reduct invariants). The
descent is ALREADY proven for that witness ⟹ this strengthening is the WHOLE remaining content ⟹ DROPS
`descent_step_Ind`. ⚠️ Re-check `seqAddAnt`/`inAnt` shapes vs Buchholz §3.2 first (the `zAxNeg` strengthening
took ~2 laps from shape mismatches).

### FORBIDDEN (unchanged from lap-144) + lap-145 additions
Witnessing ANY `ZDerivesEmptyR_descent_step` branch with `red`; the `k=⟦t⟧` term-eval framing for the Ind exit
(DISSOLVED); flat-sorrying `ZDerivesEmptyR (zK … iIndReductSeqG …)` (FALSE for lax nodes); attacking
:80/:1108/:1211/:1384/:1471 as stated; `redLeast`/μ-min (A); major-premise-tag {3,4,5,6} split; M2/M4 wiring.

---

## lap 144 — CRITICAL ¬-case CLOSED RED-FREE (`descent_step_K_critical_neg` sorry DROPS)
**Build 🟢 1326. Headline `[propext, sorryAx, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms).**
`descent_step_K_critical_neg` + the dispatcher `descent_step_K_critical` are now `#print axioms`-clean
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` (sorry-FREE, off `red`). Executes DIRECTION lap-143 step 2.

### THE advance — the lap-142 `redexJ ≤ j0` obstruction is DISSOLVED (route (b))
The ¬-case soundness `ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_neg`'s succedent half (`haux0_neg`, replaces premise `redexJ` =
the `zAxNeg` axiom, sets conclusion succedent to `A`) needed chain-threading **up to `redexJ`** — free only
when `redexJ ≤ j0` (the `chainInf_redexI_data` tip). When `redexJ > j0`, **`isChainInf_reduceR_keepTip`**
(new, InternalZ) rebuilds chain-validity at the UNCHANGED tip `j0`: on a ⊥-orbit `j0` carries `⊥`, so the
new `isChainInf` uses the `⊥`-exit disjunct, and the replaced premise (above the tip) never enters the
tip-bounded threading/rank. So only threading up to `j0` is needed. `ZDerivation_corrected_haux0_neg_botOrbit`
dispatches `redexJ ≤ j0` (standard) vs `>` (keep-tip).

### New lemmas (all `#print axioms`-clean)
- **InternalZ:** `isChainInf_reduceR_keepTip`; `chainInf_redexI_data` extended to also return the tip exit
  `chainAsucc ds j0 = seqSucc s ∨ = ⊥` (callers `irk_chainAsucc_redexI_le`, `ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_critical_all`
  updated with trailing `_`).
- **Crux2Blueprint:** `ZDerivation_corrected_haux0_neg_keepTip` / `_botOrbit`,
  `ZDerivation_iRcritGNeg_corrected_neg_botOrbit`, `ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_neg_botOrbit`; `descent_step_K_critical_neg`
  WIRED (soundness `_neg_botOrbit`, descent `iord_descent_iRKcCrit_neg`, invariants `ZRegular_/ZFresh_/ZSeqAnt_iRKcCrit_of_zK`).

### 🎉 SECOND advance this lap — Ind branch WIRED off `red`: live path now FULLY red-free
`ZDerivesEmptyR_descent_step`'s Ind root now calls the NEW named honest sorry `descent_step_Ind` (witness =
genuine `iIndReductSeqG`), NOT `⟨red d, ZDerivesEmptyR_red hd, iord_descent_red_zInd⟩`. Combined with the
critical-K case (off `red`, lap-143/144), the ENTIRE live `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` (:2331) path is now off
`red`. **The headline's open `sorryAx` traces ONLY to honest TRUE-but-unproven lemmas — no kernel-FALSE
statement remains on the path.**

### On-path sorry inventory after lap-144 (the live `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` chain) — all GENUINE
| sorry | live via | disposition |
|---|---|---|
| `descent_step_Ind` (NEW, Crux2Blueprint) | Ind root of `ZDerivesEmptyR_descent_step` | GENUINE — Ind soundness via telescope `zKValidF` + term-value `k = ⟦t⟧` (see below) |
| `descent_step_K_noncritical` | live (non-critical K) | GENUINE — Buchholz 5.2 atomic reduct |
| `exists_sigma1_descending_step` (A) | live (gDef packaging) | GENUINE — concrete `redStep`/witness-bound |
| `redSoundGen`:1616, `zKValidF_iIndReduct_of_zInd`:80, `ZDerivation_red_zK_crit`:1108, `_splice`:1211, `_nonRep`:1384 | **OFF the live path** (only pre-pivot `red^[n]` remnants reference them) | DEAD — relocate to `wip/` (mechanical cleanup, not crux work) |

### NEXT (hardest-first) — prove `descent_step_Ind` soundness
Witness = `zK s (irk p) (iIndReductSeqG d0 d1 a k)`, `a = π₁ at'`, `k = value(t)` for the Ind term `t = π₂ at'`.
- **Soundness** `ZDerivesEmptyR (zK …)`: `zKValidF` via `isChainInf_telescope` (banked) + per-premise
  read-offs `chainAnt_/chainAsucc_iIndReductSeqG_*` (banked) — base antecedent `= Γ` (`d0`'s), step antecedent
  `Γ,F(i)` threads `F(i) = chainAsucc i`, rank `irk (F(i)) = irk p` (substitution-invariant). The **`hexit`
  clause needs `F(k) = F(t)` i.e. `k = value(t)`** = the lone genuine prerequisite (internal term-evaluation
  `k = ⟦t⟧`, matching `numeral k` to the closed Ind term `t`; `substs1 (numeral k) p = substs1 t p = ⊥`).
  Plus `ZRegular/ZFresh/ZSeqAnt` of the reduct (premise-hereditary, like the K-case `*_iRKcCrit_of_zK`).
- **Descent**: `iord_descent_iIndReduct` (InternalZ:3056) via `iotil`/`idg` congruence `iIndReductSeqG ≅
  iIndReductSeq` (corresponding premises share ordinals — substitution is ordinal-invariant).
- **First sub-attack:** formalize the internal term-value `k = ⟦t⟧` (the `hexit` blocker), OR prove the
  telescope threading/rank parts modulo `hexit` (a narrower named sorry).

### FORBIDDEN (unchanged from lap-143)
Witnessing ANY `ZDerivesEmptyR_descent_step` branch with `red` (incl. the Ind branch — switch it); attacking
:80/:1108/:1211/:1384/:1471 as stated (all FALSE/dead); the `redLeast`/μ-min (A) route; the major-premise-tag
{3,4,5,6} split; `zReg`/`zFresh`/`zSeqAnt` folds as a goal; off-critical-path easy sorries; M2 / M4 wiring.

## lap 143 — DEEP REFLECTION: FINISH the existence-form pivot (witness with genuine reducts, NEVER `red`)
**Build 🟢 green (1326). Headline `[propext, sorryAx, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms), faithfulness clean,
statement re-audited — no drift.** This is an altitude lap; deliverable = `REFLECTION-2026-06-26-lap143.md` + the binding
`DIRECTION.md` CURRENT DIRECTIVE (lap-143). Summary below.

### THE finding — the lap-132 pivot was half-abandoned (laps 141-142 regressed it)
The existence-form pivot's whole point: `ZDerivesEmptyR_descent_step` (`Crux2Blueprint:1943`) returns a bare `∃ d'`, so it
can witness with ANY sound descending reduct — you NEVER prove `red`'s fixed selection faithful. But TODAY both load-bearing
branches witness with `red`:
- **Ind branch** (`:1946`): `⟨red d, ZDerivesEmptyR_red hd, iord_descent_red_zInd …⟩`.
- **critical-K** `descent_step_K_critical` (`:1891`): `⟨red (zK s r ds), ZDerivesEmptyR_red hd, iord_descent_red_zK_crit …⟩`.

Both route soundness through `ZDerivesEmptyR_red` → **`redSoundGen` (:1471), which is FALSE/incomplete**: its zInd case
(line 1498) invokes the kernel-FALSE `zKValidF_iIndReduct_of_zInd` (:80, refuted lap-136); its zK case is an open sorry
(:1508); and `ZDerivation_red_zK` (:1426) routes critical soundness through the kernel-FALSE `ZDerivation_red_zK_crit`
(:1108, refuted lap-114). So the live `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` path transitively depends on TWO kernel-verified-FALSE
sorries — un-dischargeable as stated. The genuine red-free replacement `ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_critical_all` (:1847, lap-142,
sorry-free, axiom-clean) is BANKED BUT UNWIRED → zero false-dependence dropped.

### On-path sorry inventory + dispositions (the live `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` chain)
| sorry | live via | disposition |
|---|---|---|
| `redSoundGen` :1471 (zK :1508 + zInd→FALSE :80) | Ind & critical-K (`ZDerivesEmptyR_red`) | DEAD — drop by switching witnesses |
| `ZDerivation_red_zK_crit` :1108 (kernel-FALSE) | critical-K via `red` | DEAD — drop via `iRKcCrit` |
| `zKValidF_iIndReduct_of_zInd` :80 (kernel-FALSE) | Ind via `redSoundGen` | DEAD — drop via `iIndReductSeqG` |
| `ZDerivation_red_zK_splice` :1211, `_nonRep` :1384 | only the dead `red` chain | DEAD — off-path after switch |
| `descent_step_K_noncritical` :1924 | live (non-critical K) | GENUINE — Buchholz 5.2 atomic reduct |
| `exists_sigma1_descending_step` :1992 (A) | live (gDef packaging) | GENUINE — concrete `redStep`/witness-bound |
| ¬-case `redexJ ≤ j0` (after the split) | live (critical ¬) | GENUINE — pin `j0 = lh ds−1` on ⊥-orbit |

### MANDATED next move (assemble, don't bank — `DIRECTION.md` lap-143)
1. ✅ **DONE (lap-143).** `ZSeqAnt_iRKcCrit` + `ZSeqAnt_iRKcCrit_of_zK` + `ZFresh_iRKcCrit_of_zK` + helpers
   `ZSeqAnt_zsubst_zIallPrem`/`ZSeqAnt_zInegPrem` (Zsubst.lean), mirroring `ZRegular_/ZFresh_iRKcCrit`.
2. ✅ **DONE (lap-143).** `descent_step_K_critical` SPLIT into `descent_step_K_critical_all` (I∀ — witnesses with
   `iRKcCrit`, `#print axioms` = `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, **sorry-free, NO false :1108/:80**) +
   `descent_step_K_critical_neg` (I¬ — NEW named sorry, residual = `redexJ ≤ j0`) + a polarity dispatcher. The dominant
   critical sub-case is now genuinely red-free. Build 🟢 1326.
3. **NEXT — re-witness the Ind branch** of `ZDerivesEmptyR_descent_step` (:1946) with the corrected-Ind reduct
   `iIndReductSeqG` (lap-136), not `red d`, dropping its `redSoundGen`/:80 dependence. (Currently `⟨red d, ZDerivesEmptyR_red hd, iord_descent_red_zInd …⟩`.)
4. **NEXT — close the ¬-case** `descent_step_K_critical_neg`: pin `j0 = lh ds − 1` for genuine ⊥-orbit chains
   (`isChainInf_of_last`) ⟹ `redexJ < lh ds = j0+1`; or weaken `ZDerivation_corrected_haux0_neg` to thread only up to
   `min(redexJ, j0)`. Then `ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_neg` discharges the ¬-soundness (descent = `iord_descent_iRKcCrit_neg`).
5. AFTER the live path no longer references them, relocate the DEAD `red`-soundness sorries {:80,:1108,:1211,:1384,:1471}
   to `wip/` (abandoned route — NOT before, that games the count).

### FORBIDDEN
Witnessing any `ZDerivesEmptyR_descent_step` branch with `red` (the lap-141 regression); banking more iRKcCrit/Ind
soundness without WIRING into `descent_step_*`; attacking :80/:1108/:1211/:1384/:1471 as stated (all FALSE/dead); the
`redLeast`/μ-min (A) route (refuted lap-139); the major-premise-tag {3,4,5,6} split (abandoned lap-141); `zReg`/`zFresh`/
`zSeqAnt` folds as a goal; off-critical-path easy sorries; M2 / M4 wiring.

## lap 142 — CRITICAL ∀-case soundness PROVEN via the genuine `iRKcCrit`, orbit-only (no `red`/`redSound`) [banked but UNWIRED — see lap-143]
**Build 🟢 green. Headline footprint UNCHANGED** (`[propext, sorryAx, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`). New lemmas
`#print axioms`-clean (`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, **no `sorryAx`**).

### THE advance — the operator's existence-form spike, REALIZED in-kernel for the dominant critical sub-case
`ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_critical_all` (`Crux2Blueprint`, **sorry-FREE**) proves: for a regular `∅→⊥` chain that is
critical (`¬ permIdx < lh ds`) whose R-redex is an `I∀`, the GENUINE re-keyed critical reduct `iRKcCrit (zK s r ds)`
is a `ZDerivation` — derived **purely from the orbit** (`ZDerivesEmptyR + criticality`), reusing the BANKED
per-reduct soundness `ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_all` (laps 112-119) **with NO dependence on `red`/`redSound`** (whose
critical reduct is the FALSE-as-stated instance-`0` shadow `ZDerivation_red_zK_crit`, `Crux2Blueprint:1108`) and
**NO selection-correctness campaign**. This demonstrates the operator-mandated reframe (existence form reusing
banked per-reduct soundness) end-to-end in kernel for the ∀-case — the dominant critical sub-case.

### What unblocked it — the lap-130 "exact-shape obstruction" was STALE
The lap-130 docstrings (`InternalZ:1553`, `Crux2Blueprint`) claimed `seqSucc sⱼ = cutFormula` (the `hAll` input to
`ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_*`) was "not yet derivable from `zKValid`" because the `zAxAll` ZPhi disjunct carried only
`∀p ∈ Γ`. **That strengthening already landed:** the `zAxAll` disjunct (`InternalZ:5372`) NOW carries
`zAxAllSuccWff s p k` (= `seqSucc s = F(k)`). So the obstruction is GONE. Supporting changes this lap:
- **`redZKReady_of_zKValid` extended** — its ∀-branch now also yields `seqSucc sⱼ = cutFormula` (read off via
  `zDerivation_zAxAll_inv`'s `zAxAllSuccWff`, whose instance index `k' = π₁(π₂(tp dⱼ))` matches `cutFormula`'s
  readout exactly). `zDerivation_zAxAll_inv` HOISTED above `redZKReady`. 2 destructure sites updated (`_hsj`).
- **`chainInf_redexI_data`** (new, refactored out of `irk_chainAsucc_redexI_le`) — exposes the `isChainInf` tip
  `j0` with `redexI < j0` + threading/rank up to `j0`. The ∀-case needs threading only up to `redexI`
  (`ZDerivation_iRcritG_corrected`'s `haux1` L-half takes NONE), so `redexI < j0` suffices.

### THE remaining critical residual — the ¬-case needs `redexJ ≤ j0` (NOT free from `zKValid`)
The ¬-case (`I¬` R-redex + `axNeg` L-redex) routes through `ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_neg`, whose succedent half
`ZDerivation_corrected_haux0_neg` REPLACES premise `redexJ` and so needs threading **up to `redexJ`**. From
`zKValid`'s `isChainInf` we only get threading up to the existential tip `j0`, and `redexJ ≤ j0` is **genuinely
not provable** in general: the minimal redex `⟪redexI, redexJ⟫` (= `redexCode`) could have `redexJ > j0` (e.g. a
redex `⟪0, big⟫` with `big > j0` has smaller pair-code than a `j0`-region redex, so it could be the minimum). The
∀-case dodges this because its threading-heavy half is at `redexI < j0` (provable, `chainInf_redexI_data`).

**NEXT ATTACK (hardest-first, to fully re-route `descent_step_K_critical` off `red` and drop its dependence on
the false 1108):**
1. **Prove `redexJ ≤ j0` (or `j0 = lh ds − 1`) for ⊥-orbit chains.** The genuine reducts build chains with the
   LAST premise as tip (`isChainInf_of_last`, `isChainInf_iCritReductSeq`: source FIRST, cut-user LAST), so
   `j0 = lh ds − 1` and `redexJ < lh ds = j0+1`. But `zKValid` stores only the existential `j0`. Either (a)
   strengthen the ⊥-orbit chain invariant to pin `j0 = lh ds − 1` (carried hereditarily by the embedding + reducts),
   or (b) weaken `ZDerivation_corrected_haux0_neg` to need only threading up to `min(redexJ, j0)` (when `redexJ > j0`
   the replaced premise is outside the threaded region, so the rebuilt chain keeps `j0` as tip).
2. Then `ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_botOrbit` discharges BOTH cases; `descent_step_K_critical` re-routes to witness
   `iRKcCrit` (needs also `ZSeqAnt_iRKcCrit` — derive alongside the banked `ZRegular_iRKcCrit_of_zK`/`ZFresh_iRKcCrit`/
   `fstIdx_iRKcCrit` + the banked descent `iord_descent_iRKcCrit_corr/_neg`), dropping its dependence on `red`.
3. The Ind ROOT of `ZDerivesEmptyR_descent_step` ALSO routes through `red`/`redSound`→ the false
   `zKValidF_iIndReduct_of_zInd` (`Crux2Blueprint:80`, lap-136 obstruction): genuine fix = the recursive predecessor
   cut. Once BOTH critical-K (via iRKcCrit) and Ind (via the corrected reduct) are off `red`, `redSound` (with its
   false 1108/82 + the selection-campaign sorries) LEAVES the existence-form termination path entirely.

## lap 141 — SPIKE DECIDED: existence/critical-pair reframe OBVIATES the tag-5/6 wall; K-step restructured
**Build 🟢 1326. Headline footprint UNCHANGED** (`[propext, sorryAx, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`). Commits `3ca3221`
(spike+restructure) → `0ee70e4` (correction: critical case via SOUND `red`, drop false-risk `iR2` sorry).

### The operator-mandated existence-form reframe spike — RUN, decided, then CORRECTED in-kernel
The existence / critical-pair reframe **DOES obviate** the tag-5/6 "cutPartner-is-a-principal-R-intro" residual —
**overturning lap-139's "the reframe does not obviate the deep content" FOR that sub-case.**

**Why it works (Buchholz §3.2 ground truth, `scratchpad/buchholz-gentzen.txt:648-745`):** Buchholz's K-reduction
splits on **CRITICAL vs NON-CRITICAL** (Def 3.2 case 5.1/5.2), NOT on the major premise's tag. The lap-140
tag-{3,4,5,6} decomposition was a NON-Buchholz framing, and its tag-5/6 wall (prove the major premise's partner
is a principal R-intro) is an ARTIFACT of reducing AT the major premise. In Buchholz's critical case (5.1),
Lemma 3.1 (`inference_critical_pair`, banked) returns a PRINCIPAL pair `(i,j)` with `tp dᵢ = R_{Aᵢ}` automatically
— principality FALLS OUT of criticality, no separate proof.

### ⚠️ The in-kernel CORRECTION (`#print axioms`) — use SOUND `red`, not the ordinal-shadow `iR2`
The first draft witnessed the critical reduct with `iR2 (zK s r ds)` + a soundness sorry `ZDerivesEmptyR (iR2 …)`.
**`#print axioms` + the `iRcrit`/`iCritReduct` docstrings exposed this as the WRONG reduct:** `iR2 = iRcrit` is the
ORDINAL-SHADOW (`iCritReduct`'s auxiliaries reuse `fstIdx d`, the WRONG endsequent), so `ZDerivation (iR2 …)` is
NOT in hand and `ZDerivesEmptyR (iR2 …)` is FALSE-RISK. The GENUINE sound+descending reduct is `red` (= `iRcritG`
on the critical branch, sharing `iord` with `iRcrit`). `red`'s soundness `ZDerivesEmptyR_red` is unconditional in
the orbit sense — it routes through the PRE-EXISTING red-R2 `ZDerivation_red_zK_crit` (`Crux2Blueprint:1108`).
**Lesson: verify a reduct's soundness in-kernel (`#print axioms`) BEFORE planting a soundness sorry about it.**

### THE advance — `descent_step_K_majorIdx` restructured critical/non-critical; K-step 4 sorries → 1
- **`descent_step_K_critical`** (no NEW sorry): critical case (`¬ permIdx < lh ds`) = `red` reduct; DESCENT =
  `iord_descent_red_zK_crit` (banked, sorry-free); SOUNDNESS = `ZDerivesEmptyR_red`, routed through the
  PRE-EXISTING red-R2 `ZDerivation_red_zK_crit` (1108). NO producer-principal proof (Lemma 3.1 gives the pair).
  ⚠️ `#print axioms` shows it carries `sorryAx` *via 1108* (the genuine red-R2), not via a new/false obligation.
- **`descent_step_K_noncritical`** (the ONE new sorry, `Crux2Blueprint:1865`): Buchholz case 5.2 — the
  `permIdx`-selected Rep premise replaced/spliced (I-rule/Ind → `red`-replace banked; chain → recursion;
  atom/`Ax¹` → §5 atomic reduction, the genuine lap-129 stall fix since `red` is identity on those leaves).
- Dispatcher `descent_step_K_majorIdx` sorry-FREE: `by_cases` on the `permIdx` sentinel; takes the
  `ZDerivesEmptyR (zK s r ds)` bundle directly.
- DROPPED the four `descent_step_K_tag{3,4,5,6}` sorries AND the false-risk `iR2` soundness sorry; the
  producer-principal wall (laps 139/140) is GONE.

### ⟹ Remaining crux-2 termination wall: red-R2 (`ZDerivation_red_zK_crit`, 1108) + non-critical 5.2 (1865)
Both feed the recursive reduction-soundness (Buchholz Thm 3.4(b)): the critical reduct's auxiliaries `d{0}`/`d{1}`
are `ZDerivation`s of their reduced endsequents (`ZDerivation_iRcritG_of`/`ZDerivation_iCritReductG_of` recombine
once supplied), the non-critical splice/replace from the structural IH. **NEXT ATTACK:** the Buchholz Thm
3.4(a)+(b) **simultaneous induction on the build-up of `d`**:
1. `ZDerivation_red_zK_crit` (1108): ⚠️ **NOT just "supply auxiliaries" — it is FALSE-as-stated for the current
   `red`** (lap-114 crux finding, docstring at `Crux2Blueprint:1095`): `red`'s critical reduct substitutes the
   I∀ R-redex at instance **0** (`zAxReduct (red premise) = zsubst d0 a (numeral 0)`, `red_zIall`), which is
   correct for DESCENT (`iord` is instance-invariant — why `iord_descent_red_zK_crit` is sorry-free) but WRONG
   for SOUNDNESS: `haux0`'s threading forces the R-redex succedent `= cutFormula d = F(k)` at the L-redex
   instance **k**, not 0. **The genuine fix = re-principalization at k** (Buchholz §3.2 case 5.1): re-key red's
   tag-4 critical branch to `zsubst d0 a (numeral k)` (banked blocks `seqSucc_zsubst_zIall_premise`,
   `ZDerivation_zsubst_zIall_premise`), OR route through `iRKcCrit`/`ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_all` (the engine-swap
   variant, `Crux2Blueprint:961/993`). The descent survives the 0→k change. ⚠️ NOTE the whole repo's
   `ZDerivesEmptyR_red`/`redSound` (incl. the Ind case of `ZDerivesEmptyR_descent_step`, line ~1925, and the new
   `descent_step_K_critical`) is ALREADY gated on this same 1108 — it is the standing red-soundness gap, not new.
   See `ANALYSIS-2026-06-25-lap114-inversion-instance-mismatch.md`.
2. `descent_step_K_noncritical` (1865): dispatch on the `permIdx`-selected premise's tag (mirror `iord_descent_red`,
   `Crux2Blueprint:1560`): I-rule/Ind → `red`-replace (banked); chain → recursion (cf. `iord_descent_red`'s sorry
   at ~1620); atom/`Ax¹` → §5 atomic reduct (`zAxReduct`/`zAx1`, banked descent bundles `iRedDescent_zAx1_zAx{All,Neg}`,
   `InternalZ:7983` — Buchholz Lemma 5.2 gives `o(d[n])<o(d)` for atomic `d`). ⚠️ multi-lap deep core; decompose
   into per-tag named src sub-`sorry`s next.

## lap 140 — ALTITUDE REVIEW: directive corrected + `descent_step_K_majorIdx` DECOMPOSED by tag
**[SUPERSEDED by lap-141: the tag-{3,4,5,6} decomposition is replaced by critical/non-critical. The tag-5/6
producer-principal residual described below is OBVIATED — kept for the in-kernel refutations it records.]**
**Build 🟢 1326. Headline footprint UNCHANGED** (`[propext, sorryAx, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, 0 math axioms;
`goodsteinSentence_faithful` clean). Commit covers the review (DIRECTION/STATUS) + the decomposition.

### Review outcome — lap-137 directive was materially STALE; corrected in `DIRECTION.md` (lap-140)
- Orbit (B)/(B0) it called "the load-bearing neglected piece" = **DONE** (lap 138, `exists_sigma1_iterate`/`IIter`).
- The `redLeast` μ-min route it mandated for (A) = **REFUTED** (lap 139, wrong-polarity witness bound).
- ⟹ the WHOLE crux-2 termination collapses to ONE lemma `descent_step_K_majorIdx`: M3 `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty`
  sorry-free given `InternalPRWO V` + bare-∃ step; orbit proven; (A) folds in via the concrete `redStep`.
- Repetition/crux-neglect check: laps 135→139 are CONVERGING (135 spike, 136 `iIndReductSeqG`, 137 type-fix+
  decompose, 138 orbit, 139 pair-parametric layer), not fixating. Yellow flag = lap-139 dropped no src sorry.

### THE advance this lap — `descent_step_K_majorIdx` decomposed into 4 per-tag named src sub-`sorry`s
`majorPrem_tag_mem` (tag ∈ {3,4,5,6}) drives a sorry-FREE dispatcher onto:
- **`descent_step_K_tag3`** (Ind) — reduct = corrected `iIndReductSeqG`; residual = `isChainInf_iIndReductSeqG`
  (assemble via `isChainInf_of_last`, readouts banked; pin `t=t'+1`-vs-`numeral k` exit subtlety FIRST).
- **`descent_step_K_tag4`** (chain) — relocated structural `<`-recursion into the sub-K-chain. Deep core.
- **`descent_step_K_tag5`** (∀-axiom) — principal `(i',majorIdx)` cut, `i'` = `majorPrem_zAxAll_cutPartner`;
  build on `_at` halves (`haux0_at`/`haux1_at`). Residual = cutPartner is a PRINCIPAL R-intro (`znth ds i'=zIall…`).
- **`descent_step_K_tag6`** (¬-axiom) — dual; `majorPrem_zAxNeg_cutPartner` + `_neg_at` halves.

### ⚠️ lap-140 in-kernel REFUTATION (read before attacking tag-5/6) — the `redZKReady` shortcut is BLOCKED
A tempting shortcut: a ⊥-orbit K-node is `zKValidF` (from `ZDerivation`), so just apply `redZKReady_of_zKValid`
(`InternalZ:8338`) — it ALREADY delivers a principal critical pair with the R-intro form
(`znth ds redexI = zIall …`/`zIneg …`) via the `redexCode`/Lemma-3.1 finder, sidestepping the cutPartner gap.
**REFUTED:** `redZKReady_of_zKValid` needs `zKValid = zKValidF ∧ zKCritical` (`zKValid_iff_zKValidF_and_zKCritical`,
`InternalZ:1428`), and `zKCritical s ds = ∀ i, ¬ iperm (tp dᵢ) s` is **FALSE on the ⊥-orbit**: an isymRep premise
(Ind/K/atom/Ax¹, tags 3/4/0/7 — and the major premise IS one) has `iperm isymRep s` UNCONDITIONALLY
(`iperm_isymRep`), violating `¬iperm`. This is the lap-129 criticality stall restated: the global-criticality
finder cannot run on a non-critical ⊥-chain. ⟹ the cutPartner route is genuinely NECESSARY for tag-5/6.

### ⚠️ lap-140 SHARPENED tag-5/6 residual — `cutPartner is R-intro` ⟺ `tp(i') = isymR (^∀p)`, rule out 2 cases
Every chain premise has `iperm (tp dᵢ) (fstIdx dᵢ)` (from `zKValidF`), so by the permissibility trichotomy
(`iperm`, `InternalZ:979`) `tp dᵢ ∈ {isymR (seqSucc dᵢ), isymLk k A (A∈ant), isymRep}`. For the cutPartner `i'`
(`chainAsucc ds i' = ^∀p`, from `majorPrem_zAxAll_cutPartner`): if `tp i' = isymR C` then `iperm_isymR_iff` FORCES
`C = seqSucc(fstIdx i') = ^∀p`, i.e. `tp i' = isymR (^∀p)` = the zIall R-intro `haux0_at` needs (and then
`(i', majorIdx)` is a genuine `isRedexPair`). **So the ENTIRE tag-5/6 deep content = ruling out the OTHER two
trichotomy cases for the ∀p-producer:** `tp i' = isymLk k A` (another L-axiom with succedent ^∀p) and
`tp i' = isymRep` (an Ind/K/atom passing ^∀p through). This is a LOCALIZED `inference_critical_pair_of_chain`
that does NOT need global criticality — it uses the SPECIFIC datum that majorIdx is the L-axiom of ^∀p and ^∀p
threads back. Either (a) prove SOME ∀p-producer upstream of majorIdx is an R-intro (a leastness/threading argument,
cf. `firstBotPrem_reducible` + `chainAsucc_threaded_of_leaf` rule out the atom/Ax¹ leaves; the residual is
isymLk-axiom + Ind/K), OR (b) build a general internal ∀-INVERSION (`ZDerivation Γ→∀p ⟹ ZDerivation Γ→p[k]`,
Buchholz Inversion Lemma — handles ANY ∀p-producer, not just zIall; the `_at` halves would then take the inverted
derivation). **DECIDE (a)-vs-(b) by reading Buchholz §5 + the zInd/zK/zAxAll succedent forms BEFORE building.**

### ✅ lap-140 LANDED (green, axiom-clean) — explicit-pair ∀-case SOUNDNESS `ZDerivation_iCritReductG_all_at`
lap-139 NEXT **step 1 is DONE** (`Crux2Blueprint`, before `ZDerivation_iRcritG_corrected`): the pair-parametric
assembly of the `_at` halves (`haux0_at` + `haux1_at`) into a full `ZDerivation` of the CLOSED critical reduct
`iCritReductG s (cutFormulaAt i j (zK s r ds)) (r-1) r r (seqUpdate ds i (zsubst d0 a (numeral k))) (seqUpdate ds
j (zAx1 …))`, at an ARBITRARY pair `(i,j)` — NO `redexI/redexJ`, NO `iRcritG`, via `ZDerivation_iCritReductG_of`
directly. Takes `hdi : znth ds i = zIall …` as a HYPOTHESIS, so it is INDEPENDENT of the cutPartner residual. The
cut-rank STRICT drop `irk (cutFormulaAt i j d) ≤ r−1` is `irk_substs1_lt_all` on the I∀ matrix (`cutFormulaAt_all`).
**This is the soundness SKELETON `descent_step_K_tag5` instantiates.** (≈ +40 lines, 0 new sorry.)

### NEXT (hardest-first, per DIRECTION.md lap-140) — wire the skeleton into a tag-5 DROP
1. **tag-5 remaining** (now that soundness is banked): to close `descent_step_K_tag5`, supply at `(i,j) =
   (cutPartner, majorIdx)`: (i) **the cutPartner residual** `hdi` — discharge `znth ds cutPartner = zIall …` via
   the (a)/(b) decision above (the genuine deep gap); (ii) **the orbit-data hyps** of `ZDerivation_iCritReductG_all_at`
   (freshness `hfresh_eig`/`hpfresh`/`hΓfresh` from `ZFresh`, `hthread`/`hrank`/`hrankI` from the chain, `hsj` from
   the L-axiom/cutPartner being on the same `^∀p`, `Seq` facts) — these mirror the deterministic orbit-data
   suppliers (laps 113-128, keyed off `redexI`; re-key to `(cutPartner, majorIdx)`); (iii) **regularity**
   `ZDerivesEmptyR (iCritReductG …)` (the reduct stays a regular ⊥-derivation — `fstIdx` unchanged = `s`, so
   `seqAnt=∅`/`seqSucc=^⊥` preserved; `ZRegular`/`ZFresh`/`ZSeqAnt` of the reduct, cf. banked `ZRegular_iRKcCrit`);
   (iv) **descent** `icmp (iord (iCritReductG …)) (iord (zK s r ds)) = 0` via `iord_descent_iRcrit_of_chain'`
   (pair-parametric). Build (iii)+(iv) next (independent of the cutPartner residual); they + the skeleton reduce
   tag-5 to exactly the residual + orbit-data plumbing.
2. **tag-3**: assemble `isChainInf_iIndReductSeqG` (lap-138 NEXT, readouts banked; exit subtlety pinned first).
⚠️ Forbidden: `redLeast`/μ for (A); engine re-key of `red`/`redexI`/`redexJ`; `red dⱼ` single-replace for tag-3;
the `redZKReady_of_zKValid` shortcut (needs `zKCritical`, FALSE on the ⊥-orbit — see refutation above).

## lap 139 — critical-cut half-derivation layer made PAIR-PARAMETRIC (dissolves the tag-5/6 engine re-key)
**Build 🟢 1326. Headline footprint UNCHANGED.** 3 green commits (`bde9e72`→`a4076c6`→`d5e9e44`). **No src sorry
dropped — none was feasible.** Advance = a structural unlock + the decisive primary/secondary reconciliation.

### ⚖️ DIRECTION reconciliation — the primary (A) and the secondary `descent_step_K_majorIdx` are the SAME content
DIRECTION.md (lap-137) = hardest-first **(A) `exists_sigma1_descending_step`** (the Σ₁ ε₀-descent), secondary =
`descent_step_K_majorIdx`. This lap settled they're coupled:
- **(A) via `redLeast` μ-min is BLOCKED on a wrong-polarity witness bound.** The μ graph is `𝚫₁`, but a TOTAL
  `g : V → V` (IIter/(B0) needs it) requires off-orbit completion whose graph has a Π₁ disjunct (`¬∃d', P(w,d')`,
  unbounded) ⟹ `g`'s graph is `Σ₁ ∨ Π₁`, not `Σ₁`. Needs a primrec witness bound `∃ d' ≤ B(w), P(w,d')`. Unbuilt.
- **(A) via the concrete `redStep`:** total `𝚺₁` PR.Construction ⟹ `gDef` FREE; its descent clause IS
  `descent_step_K_majorIdx`. ⟹ **the secondary front is the tractable path to the primary.** Crux-1 delivers the
  SEQUENCE-form `InternalPRWO` (not ε₀-LNP), so a least-element restructure can't shed (A) either. The
  existence-form reframe does NOT obviate the deep content (re-confirmed, fresh angles).

### ⭐ THE advance — full pair-parametric critical-cut half-derivation layer (Crux2Blueprint)
Soundness was already pair-parametric at the `iCritReductG` level (`ZDerivation_iCritReductG_of`, takes modified
premise seqs explicitly); REPLACE workhorse index-parametric. Lone obstruction to an ARBITRARY-pair principal cut
(no engine re-key): `cutFormula d` reads `redexI/redexJ`. **Landed (proven, axiom-clean, 0 new sorries):**
- `cutFormulaAt i j d` + `cutFormulaAt_redex` (`= cutFormula` by `rfl`) + `cutFormulaAt_all`/`_neg` readouts.
- All FOUR halves as explicit-pair `_at` twins (originals delegate as `(redex,…)` instances):
  `haux0_at {i j}`, `haux1_at {j Cc}`, `haux1_neg_at {i Cc}`, `haux0_neg_at {j Cc}` — full tag-5/6 soundness
  supply at any cut pair, NO `redexI/redexJ`.

### NEXT (the tag-5/6 existence-form assembly) — concrete, ordered
1. **Explicit-pair `iCritReductG` soundness** at an arbitrary pair: assemble the `_at` halves via
   `ZDerivation_iCritReductG_of` directly (NOT `iRcritG`, which bakes `redexI/redexJ`). Thread the cut-rank drop
   `irk (cutFormulaAt i j d) ≤ zKrank d − 1` (∀: `irk_cutFormula_lt`-style on `cutFormulaAt_all` + `irk_substs1`).
2. **Wire `(cutPartner, majorIdx)`** via banked `majorPrem_zAx{All,Neg}_cutPartner`. ⚠️ **GENUINE GAP:** the
   cutPartner `i'` has SUCCEDENT `^∀p`/`inegF p` but `haux0_at` needs `znth ds i' = zIall…` (a PRINCIPAL R-intro).
   Proving the cutPartner is a principal R-intro is the deep tag-5/6 residual now (Buchholz criticality).
3. **Descent:** `iord_descent_iRcrit_of_chain'` is already pair-parametric (six bundle facts); re-key callers off
   `redexI/redexJ` to `(i', majorIdx)`.
4. Then `descent_step_K_majorIdx` tag-5/6 = (1+2)+(3); (A) via concrete `redStep` (Ind=`red d`; K tag-5/6=this;
   tag-3=`iIndReductSeqG`; tag-4=recursion).
⚠️ Do NOT re-key the engine, do NOT chase `redLeast`/μ without a witness bound.

## lap 138 — (B0) iteration linchpin DISCHARGED via the repo's own `IIter`; Σ₁-orbit half VALIDATED
**Build 🟢 1326. Headline footprint UNCHANGED** (`[propext, sorryAx, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, 0 math axioms).

### THE advance (a real src `sorry` dropped on the termination path)
**(B0) `exists_sigma1_iterate` PROVEN** (was `sorry`); with it **(B) `exists_sigma1_descent_of_sigma1_step` fully
PROVEN** (was proven-modulo-(B0)). Both axiom-clean. The lap-137 baton's "no generic Foundation iteration combinator
exists (HFS has none)" **missed that the repo already built one for crux-1**: `IIter.iIter fDef f hf x c = f^[c] x`
(`src/GoodsteinPA/IIter.lean`), a genuine `𝚺₁` `PR.Construction` over an arbitrary parameter-free-defined `f`.
So `orbit n := IIter.iIter gDef g hg z n` discharges (B0) in three lines (`iIter_zero`/`iIter_succ` + a
`DefinableFunction₂.comp` on `iIter_definable'`). The lap-137 parameter-free SUBTLETY is now **resolved by the
statement**: (B0)'s hypothesis is the explicit `hg : 𝚺₁.DefinedFunction₁ g gDef` (parameter-free `gDef`), threaded
back through (B) and (A). (Added acyclic `import GoodsteinPA.IIter`.)

**De-risks the pivot:** the handoff flagged (B0) as the decisive test — "if the `𝚺₁`-orbit can't be built, the pivot
is hollow." **It builds cleanly; the pivot is NOT hollow.** The orbit→NF→descent→PRWO machinery is now fully closed.

### NEXT (PRIMARY, hardest-first) — termination half = (A) [concrete `redStep`] + `descent_step_K_majorIdx` [deep core]
Two open sorries on the path. **(A) and `descent_step_K_majorIdx` share one need: a CONCRETE deterministic descending
reduct FUNCTION (not a bare `∃`).** Route:
1. Define concrete `redStep : V → V` (parameter-free `𝚺₁` ⟹ explicit `redStepDef`): Ind root `redStep d := red d`
   (concrete; descent `iord_descent_red_zInd` PROVEN); K root `redStep d :=` major-premise-replace reduct
   (`seqUpdate`/`zKseq` with the `majorIdx` premise replaced by its reduct — all concrete `𝚺₁`).
2. (A) `exists_sigma1_descending_step` (`Crux2Blueprint:1669`) becomes immediate: `g := redStep`, `gDef := redStepDef`,
   descent = `ZDerivesEmptyR_descent_step` re-cast to return `redStep d`.
3. `descent_step_K_majorIdx` (`Crux2Blueprint:1614`) stays the deep `𝗜𝚺₁` Gentzen cut-reduction (tag-3 Ind via the
   corrected `iIndReductSeqG`, tag-5/6 principal-cut via banked `cutPartner`/`hAll`, tag-4 chain `<`-recursion).

Order: **(i) define `redStep`/`redStepDef`** (mechanical, banks (A)'s shell), **(ii) grind `descent_step_K_majorIdx`**.
⚠️ Avoid the `μ`/witness-bound route for (A) — the concrete engine reduct sidesteps the wrong-polarity totality guard.

### ⚠️ lap-138 STRUCTURAL FINDINGS (read before attacking (A) / `descent_step_K_majorIdx` — avoid two traps)
**(1) `g := red` is NOT (A)'s descending step.** `red` is valid everywhere (`ZDerivesEmptyR_red`, PROVEN — `red d`
stays a regular ⊥-derivation for ANY `d`) and descends on **Ind roots** (`iord_descent_red_zInd`), but **STALLS on
K roots** (the original defect: `iord (red d) = iord d`). So `red` fails the descent clause on K roots. A descending
step needs the **majorIdx-keyed** K-reduct, whose descent on K roots IS `descent_step_K_majorIdx`. (A) genuinely
couples to `descent_step_K_majorIdx`; there is no `red`-only shortcut.

**(2) `descent_step_K_majorIdx` tag-3 is NOT "descent-proven + soundness-sorry" — naive decomposition plants a FALSE
sorry.** The banked `descent_K_majorIdx_Ind_descends` proves descent for the single-replace witness
`zK s r (seqUpdate ds m (red dⱼ))` (dⱼ = the Ind major premise) — but that witness is the **ORDINAL SHADOW**: `iord`
is instance-invariant so it descends, yet its **chain-VALIDITY** is exactly the lap-136 obstruction
(`zKValidF_iIndReduct_of_zInd` FALSE — `red dⱼ = iRInd dⱼ` is the invalid `k=1` reduct `⟨d1,d0⟩`, which forces a
degenerate Ind term; refuted in-kernel by `zKValidF_iIndReduct_forces_degenerate`). So `ZDerivesEmptyR` of the
single-replace witness is FALSE for a genuine Ind node — do NOT decompose tag-3 with the `red dⱼ` witness.

**The genuine tag-3 reduct** is the lap-136 **corrected substituted chain** `iIndReductSeqG d0 d1 a k = ⟨d0,
d1[a:=0], …, d1[a:=k-1]⟩` (k = value of the Ind term `t`). Its `PR.Construction`/`seq`/`lh`/`znth` infra is BUILT
(`Crux2Blueprint:196-270`), but its **VALIDITY IS NOT YET ASSEMBLED** — no `isChainInf_iIndReductSeqG` /
`ZDerivation_iIndReductSeqG` / `zKValidF_iIndReductSeqG` exists yet. **THE concrete tag-3 next attack:** prove the
corrected chain is a valid derivation that descends — i.e. `isChainInf s (irk p) (iIndReductSeqG d0 d1 a k)` (exit at
the last premise `d1[a:=k-1]` deriving `F(k)=seqSucc s`; threading `F(i)→F(i+1)` via `znth_iIndReductSeqG_step` +
`seqSucc_zsubst_zInd_step`) and `iord(iIndReductSeqG-reduct) ≺ iord(zInd…)`. This is the deep lap-136 core, on the
tag-3 critical path; it is what BOTH `descent_step_K_majorIdx` tag-3 AND (via (A)) the whole termination half need.

**lap-138 (later) — readouts BANKED toward the `isChainInf` assembly.** Sorry-free `chainAsucc`/`chainAnt`
readouts of the corrected reduct landed (`Crux2Blueprint`, after `znth_iIndReductSeqG_step`):
`chainAsucc_iIndReductSeqG_zero/_step`, `chainAnt_iIndReductSeqG_zero/_step`, and `chainAsucc_iIndReductSeqG_last`
(index-`k` form, the exit clause's readout) — resolving the per-premise end-sequent projections that
`isChainInf_of_last` (`InternalZ:1208`, the reusable last-premise reduction) consumes.
**NEXT (assemble `isChainInf_iIndReductSeqG` via `isChainInf_of_last`, j0 = last index k):** three sub-goals —
(i) **last-succedent**: `chainAsucc … k = seqSucc s` — `chainAsucc_iIndReductSeqG_last` (BANKED) gives `= seqSucc
(fstIdx (d1[a:=numeral(k-1)]))`, then `seqSucc_zsubst_zInd_step` gives `= substs1 (qqAdd (numeral(k-1)) (numeral 1)) p`.
(ii) **threading**: premise `i+1` antecedent `Γ,F(i)` — `Γ` → `seqAnt s`, `F(i)` → `chainAsucc … i` (prior premise);
reads `chainAnt_iIndReductSeqG_step` + d1's antecedent structure (`Γ,F(a)` substituted). (iii) **rank**:
`irk (chainAsucc … i) ≤ irk p` — substitution-invariance of `irk` on the `F(i)` succedents.

### ⚠️ lap-138 SUBTLETY found at the exit clause (resolve FIRST — it sets the assembly's hypothesis form)
The numeral lemma exists: **`numeral_succ_pos (0 < n) : numeral (n+1) = numeral n ^+ 𝟏`** (`= qqAdd (numeral n)
(numeral 1)`, Foundation `Bootstrapping/Syntax/Term/Functions.lean:750`). So the last-premise succedent
`substs1 (qqAdd (numeral (k-1)) (numeral 1)) p = substs1 (numeral k) p` **ONLY for `k ≥ 2`** (needs `0 < k-1`).
For **k=1** the step is `qqAdd (numeral 0) (numeral 1) = qqAdd 𝟎 𝟏`, which is NOT syntactically `numeral 1 = 𝟏`
(`substs1 (qqAdd 𝟎 𝟏) p ≠ substs1 𝟏 p` — different term substituted); **k=0** the reduct is `⟨d0⟩` (base only,
succedent `F(0)`). So the Ind conclusion succedent `seqSucc s = substs1 t p` does NOT match the reduct's exit as
`t = numeral k` at the edges — the reduct is keyed to the Ind term `t`'s SYNTACTIC `+1` structure (Buchholz: `t =
t'+1 → recurse`, `t = 0 → base`), not a flattened numeral. **THE next-attack ORDER:** pin the exact
`iIndReductSeqG`↔Ind-term correspondence (what `k` is vs `t = π₂ at'`, and whether the conclusion succedent the
exit must hit is `F(t)` with `t` retaining `+1`-structure, or `F(numeral k)` only for `k≥2` with k=0,1 special) —
this DECIDES whether the assembly hypothesis is `zIndTerm = numeral k` (k≥2) or a structural `t = t'+1`. Do this
BEFORE stating `isChainInf_iIndReductSeqG`, else the exit sub-goal is mis-stated. (Also: `seqSucc_zsubst_zInd_step`
needs freshness `fvSubst a (numeral i) p = p` — from `ZFresh`/the orbit, NOT bare `ZDerivation`.)

## lap 137 — ⚠️ ALTITUDE REVIEW: existence-form termination half was MIS-TYPED (Gödel-barred); FIXED + decomposed
**Build 🟢 1326. Headline footprint UNCHANGED** (`[propext, sorryAx, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, 0 math axioms).
Fresh-mind review of the lap-135 existence-form pivot + lap-136 Ind-reduct work.

### THE finding (decisive, structural)
`prwo_forbids_existence_descent` (lap-135) concluded `False` in bare `[V ⊧ₘ* 𝗜𝚺₁]` with **NO PRWO/γ hypothesis**.
**That is UNPROVABLE.** Argument: its hypothesis `hstep` = `ZDerivesEmptyR_descent_step` (the per-step cut-reduction
descent) is a genuine `𝗜𝚺₁` fact (cut-reduction lowering the ordinal is primrec/arithmetizable). If
`prwo_forbids_existence_descent` were ALSO `𝗜𝚺₁`-provable, then `𝗜𝚺₁ ⊢ (hstep) → ZDerivesEmptyR z → False`, i.e.
`𝗜𝚺₁ ⊢ ¬∃z, ZDerivesEmptyR z` = "Z proves no `∅→⊥`" ≈ `Con(𝗣𝗔)` (via M2 `Z ⊇ 𝗣𝗔`) — **Gödel-barred**. Since the
per-step descent IS `𝗜𝚺₁`, the termination half is the one carrying the PA-unprovable strength `PRWO(ε₀)`, which
**must enter as a hypothesis**. The lap-136 grind went deep into the *other* (legitimately-`𝗜𝚺₁`) sub-sorry's
Ind-reduct redesign while this structural hole sat undiagnosed → crux-neglect on the termination half.

### FIXED this lap (green, banked — `Crux2Blueprint.lean`)
- **`InternalPRWO V`** (new `def`): `∀ f : V→V, 𝚺₁-Function₁ f → (∀ n, isNF (f n)) → ¬(∀ n : V, icmp (f(n+1)) (f n)=0)`
  — no `𝚺₁`-definable internal NF sequence is everywhere `icmp`-descending = **PRWO(ε₀)**. NOT an `𝗜𝚺₁` theorem;
  crux-1's deliverable, derived from `V ⊧ γ` (an `icmp`-descending `𝚺₁` seq feeds `bbeta`/`nonterminating_internal`
  → non-terminating Goodstein run → contradicts `V ⊧ γ`).
- **`prwo_forbids_existence_descent (hprwo : InternalPRWO V) (hstep) (hz)`** + **`false_of_ZDerivesEmpty (hprwo) (hz)`**
  — now sorry-FREE compositions threading `hprwo`.
- **`exists_sigma1_descent_of_step (hstep) (hz) : ∃ f, (𝚺₁-Function₁ f) ∧ (∀ n, isNF (f n)) ∧ (∀ n : V, icmp (f(n+1)) (f n)=0)`**
  — the NEW named sub-sorry = the genuine remaining termination content (build the `𝚺₁` `ε₀`-descent).

### NEXT (PRIMARY, hardest-first) — discharge `exists_sigma1_descent_of_step` — DECOMPOSED into (A)+(B) (lap 137, green)
`exists_sigma1_descent_of_step` is now a **sorry-FREE composition** of two named sub-sorries:
- **(A) `exists_sigma1_descending_step`** — a *total* `𝚺₁` step `g : V→V` that descends on `ZDerivesEmptyR`.
  ⚠️ **THE definability crux (lap-137 finding):** `g w := μ d'. [ZDerivesEmptyR d' ∧ icmp(iord d')(iord w)=0]`
  has a `𝚫₁` matrix (so *minimality* `∀z<d', ¬P` is `𝚫₁`), but the *totality guard* `∃d', P w d'` is `𝚺₁`
  (unbounded witness — reducts can be LARGER codes), the wrong polarity for a `𝚺₁` graph. **Two attacks:**
  (a) a primrec **WITNESS BOUND** `∃d' ≤ B(w), P w d'` ⟹ bounded-`μ` is `𝚫₁`-total (see `wip/WitnessBound.lean`);
  (b) make `ZDerivesEmptyR_descent_step`/`descent_step_K_majorIdx` yield a **constructive** reduct (Ind=`red d`,
  K=critical reduct) instead of a bare `∃`, then `g` = that function directly (no minimization). (b) ties (A)
  to the secondary front but kills the definability problem outright — likely the cleaner route.
- **(B) `exists_sigma1_descent_of_sigma1_step`** — given such a `𝚺₁` `g`, build the `𝚺₁` orbit.
  **✅ lap-137: FULLY PROVEN modulo the single iteration linchpin (B0).** The descent (`horbit_succ`+`hg_step`),
  NF (`isNF_iotower`∘`isNF_iotil_of_ZDerivation`), membership-induction (`ISigma1.sigma1_succ_induction`),
  and BOTH definability side-goals (`ZDerivesEmptyR∘orbit` `𝚺₁`-Predicate; `iord∘orbit` `𝚺₁`-Function₁, via
  `definability` after `unfold`+orbit-instance) are all closed. (B) ⟹ (B0).
- **(B0) `exists_sigma1_iterate`** — the reusable "internal `𝚺₁` iteration of a `𝚺₁` function is `𝚺₁`" lemma
  (`𝚺₁-Function₁ g → ∃ orbit, 𝚺₁-Function₁ orbit ∧ orbit 0 = z ∧ ∀ n:V, orbit(n+1)=g(orbit n)`). Manual
  `PR.Construction` (`iotower`/`zRegTable` template). **⚠️ lap-137 finding:** `PR.Blueprint.succ` is a
  PARAMETER-FREE `Semisentence`, but `𝚺₁-Function₁ g` (`Definable`) gives only a PARAMETRIZED `Semiformula V k`.
  So abstract-`g` iteration doesn't go through directly — **fix: strengthen the hyp to parameter-free
  `DefinedFunction₁ g φ` (explicit `φ : 𝚺₁.Semisentence 2`), supplied by the concrete (A) step (iord/icmp/
  ZDerivesEmptyR are all param-free), then `Blueprint.succ := φ` rewired.** No generic Foundation iteration
  combinator exists (HFS checked). ATTACK (B0) next (the Foundation-engineering linchpin).

Original decomposition note (the `iord_iR2_iterate_descends` `InternalZ:9816` internalization), now realized as (A)+(B):
1. **`redLeast : V → V`** — `μ d'. [ZDerivesEmptyR d' ∧ icmp (iord d') (iord d) = 0]`. Well-defined & `𝚺₁` because the
   matrix is `𝚫₁`: `ZDerivesEmptyR` = `ZDerivation` (`𝚫₁`, `InternalZ:5542`) ∧ `seqAnt=∅` ∧ `seqSucc=⊥` ∧ `ZRegular`/
   `ZFresh`/`ZSeqAnt` (= `zReg`/`zFresh`/`zSeqAnt` `= 0`, each a `𝚺₁`-`Function₁` — `Zsubst:1298` etc.); `iord` is
   `𝚺₁` (`InternalZ:2536`); `icmp _ _ = 0` is `𝚫₁`. Totality on the orbit from `hstep`. Look for an existing
   least-number / `μ` operator in Foundation (`ISigma1`, `Vorspiel`); else `findLeast`-style via `𝚺₁`-LNP.
2. **internal `𝚺₁` orbit `redOrbit z : V → V`** — `n ↦ redLeast^[n] z` as a course-of-values `𝚺₁` recursion
   (internal `n : V`). This is THE load-bearing internalization. Check Foundation for a `𝚺₁` iteration primitive
   (the descent infra so far uses meta `Function.iterate`, external ℕ — see the `InternalZ:9807` note "internalizing
   the (external-ℕ) iteration as a `𝚺₁` graph is what discharges the crux-2 deep axiom"). If none, this is its own
   sub-tower (decompose further; expected multi-lap but RIGHT — it is the termination internalization).
3. **`f n := iord (redOrbit z n)`** — `𝚺₁` (iord ∘ `𝚺₁`), NF (`isNF_iotower` on `isNF_iotil_of_ZDerivation`, since
   each orbit point is `ZDerivesEmptyR` ⟹ `ZDerivation`), descends (`hstep` at each orbit point, kept in
   `ZDerivesEmptyR` by `ZDerivesEmptyR`-closure under the chosen reduct).

**Why PRIMARY (hardest-first):** closing `exists_sigma1_descent_of_step` VALIDATES the existence-form pivot
end-to-end (proves "existence step ⟹ `𝚺₁` descent ⟹ (under PRWO) False" actually works). If it WALLS (e.g. the
`𝚺₁`-orbit can't be built), the whole pivot is hollow and we must know before more `descent_step_K_majorIdx` grind.

### Secondary front (genuinely required, resume after the termination half is locked)
`descent_step_K_majorIdx` (`Crux2Blueprint:1613`) — the per-step `𝗜𝚺₁` cut-reduction descent. tag-3 Ind soundness
via the corrected reduct `iIndReductSeqG` (lap-136, mid-redesign; assemble `zKValidF_iIndReductSeqG` per lap-136
handoff). tag-4 (chain) = the deep core, untouched. tag-5/6 = banked `cutPartner` + `hAll`.

### Downstream (M3 wiring, do NOT attack now — forbidden by directive)
`false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` now correctly takes `hprwo : InternalPRWO V`. Its eventual consumers must supply PRWO from
crux-1: `M ⊧ 𝗣𝗔` + `M ⊧ γ` ⟹ (crux-1, Rathjen §3) `M ⊧ PRWO(ε₀)` ⟹ `InternalPRWO M`. That `InternalPRWO`-from-crux-1
lemma + M2 `foundation_bot_to_Z_empty` + the headline wiring are the M3 endgame (separate from M1b-term).

---

## lap 136 — ⚠️ KERNEL-VERIFIED OBSTRUCTION: `zKValidF_iIndReduct_of_zInd` is FALSE; the `red` Ind reduct is fundamentally wrong
**Build 🟢 1326. Headline axiom footprint UNCHANGED.** Attacked the lap-135 handoff's recommended "tractable"
target `zKValidF_iIndReduct_of_zInd` (Crux2Blueprint:79 — gates tag-3 (Ind) soundness of `descent_step_K_majorIdx`
AND `redSoundGen`'s Ind branch). Found it is **FALSE as stated**, and proved the obstruction IN-KERNEL (two new
sorry-free theorems, green): `isChainInf_iIndReduct_exit` + `zKValidF_iIndReduct_forces_degenerate`.

### The finding (decisive, kernel-verified)
The engine's Ind reduct is `red (zInd s at' p d0 d1) = iRInd = zK s (irk p) (iIndReductSeq d0 d1 1)` with
`iIndReductSeq d0 d1 1 = ⟨d1, d0⟩` (index 0 = step `d1`, index 1 = base `d0`; `lh = 2`). For this `zK` to be a
genuine `ZDerivation` it needs `zKValidF`, whose `isChainInf` conjunct has an **exit clause**: some premise
`j0 ∈ {0,1}` must carry the conclusion succedent (`chainAsucc ds j0 = seqSucc s`) or `⊥`. But:
- premise succedents are `seqSucc (fstIdx d1) = F(a+1)` and `seqSucc (fstIdx d0) = F(0)` (from `zIndWff`),
- conclusion succedent is `seqSucc s = F(t)` where `t = π₂ at'` is the Ind term.

So a valid reduct chain **forces `F(t) ∈ {F(a+1), F(0)}`** (modulo `⊥`) — i.e. the term must be degenerate
(`t=0`, or `t` substituting into `p` like `a+1`). For a genuine Ind node with an arbitrary closed term (e.g.
`t = numeral 5`, `a` fresh) this is **violated**. `zKValidF_iIndReduct_forces_degenerate` proves exactly this
constraint in-kernel. (Also: the order is BACKWARDS vs the proven good reduct `isChainInf_iCritReductSeq`
— source FIRST, cut-user LAST — and threading at `d1` would need the eigenvar formula `F(a) ∈ Γ`, false.)

### Why no finite fix is both valid AND descending (the deep point — also kernel-checked)
`iotil_zInd` (proven simp lemma) shows `iotil (zInd s at' p d0 d1)` depends **only on `iotil d0`/`iotil d1`** —
NOT on `at'` (term/eigenvar) or `p`. Consequences:
- The current `⟨d1,d0⟩` reduct **descends** (`iord_descent_iRInd_zInd`, PROVEN) but is **not valid** (above).
  It is purely the *ordinal shadow*; that's why `zKValidF_iIndReduct_of_zInd` was always left `sorry`.
- A "predecessor cut" reduct `⟨Ind@F(t'), d1[a:=t']⟩` (for `t=t'+1`) WOULD validate but **cannot descend**:
  the predecessor `Ind@F(t')` has the SAME `d0,d1`, hence the SAME `iotil` as the original, so the chain fold
  exceeds the original ordinal. Valid xor descending — you cannot have both with a *finite, single-step* reduct.

### The genuine correct reduct (the concrete next attack, math verified by hand)
`red (Ind@F(t))` must be the **substituted multi-step chain** of length `k+1` where `k =` the VALUE of the term `t`:
```
⟨ d0,  d1[a:=numeral 0],  d1[a:=numeral 1],  …,  d1[a:=numeral (k-1)] ⟩   -- base FIRST, substituted steps after
```
- **Validity** ✓: premise 0 = `d0 : Γ→F(0)` threads (`Γ⊆Γ`); premise `i+1 = d1[a:=i] : Γ,F(i)→F(i+1)`
  threads its `F(i)` against premise `i`'s succedent `F(i)`; exit `j0=k` carries `F(k)=F(t)=seqSucc s`.
- **Descent** ✓: each `d1[a:=i]` has `iotil = iotil d1` (substitution preserves structure), so the fold is
  `ω^{õd1}·k ⊕ ω^{õd0} < ω^{õd0} ⊕ ω^{õd1+ω} = iotil(Ind)` (since `ω^{õd1}·k < ω^{õd1+ω}` for any `k`).
- `k` (nonstandard-safe) is the decoded value of `t = π₂ at'`; the substituted-step block is a primitive-recursive
  `Seq` construction (a `seqRec` over `i ↦ d1[a:=numeral i]`). This is the real redesign.

**This redesign ripples** through every descent lemma keyed to the current `iIndReductSeq d0 d1 1`
(`iseqNaddIdg_iIndReductSeq`, `icmp_iotil_iIndReduct`, `idg_zK_iIndReduct`, `iRedDescent_zInd`,
`iord_descent_iRInd_zInd`, `descent_K_majorIdx_Ind_descends`) — multi-lap, but it is the genuine Buchholz Ind→cut-chain.

### Ordered next attacks (all on M1b-term)
1. **Build the corrected reduct** `iIndReductSeqG d0 d1 a k := ⟨d0, d1[a:=0..k-1]⟩` (seqRec) + prove
   `zKValidF` for it (now PROVABLE — the threading is the `isChainInf_iCritReductSeq` pattern, generalized to
   `k` steps) + re-prove the iotil fold descent. Then re-key `iRInd`/`red_zInd` and ripple-fix the descent infra.
   This is the genuine fix and the right hardest-first target.
   - **PROGRESS (lap 136, green) — two pieces landed sorry-free:**
     1. **`isChainInf_telescope`** (Crux2Blueprint, after the obstruction theorems): any length-`k+1`
        sequence whose antecedents telescope (premise 0 ⊆ Γ; premise `i+1` ⊆ Γ∪{succ of premise `i`}; last
        premise carries `seqSucc s`/`⊥`; ranks bounded) is `isChainInf`-valid. THE validity core.
     2. **`iIndReductSeqG`** (Crux2Blueprint, the corrected reduct sequence): full PR-construction +
        recursion eqs (`iIndReductSeqG_zero/_succ`) + `𝚺₁-Function₄` definability + structural lemmas
        (`iIndReductSeqG_seq`, `iIndReductSeqG_lh = k+1`) + the read-outs `znth_iIndReductSeqG_zero` (premise 0
        = `d0`) and `znth_iIndReductSeqG_step` (premise `i+1` = `zsubst d1 a (numeral i)`, for `i<k`).
     3. **`seqSucc_zsubst_zInd_step`** (Crux2Blueprint): the Ind-step succedent identity —
        `seqSucc (fstIdx (zsubst d1 (π₁ at') t)) = substs1 (t ^+ 𝟏) p` (modulo eigenvar freshness
        `fvSubst (π₁ at') t p = p`). The telescoping succedent `chainAsucc` of premise `i+1` (`t = numeral i`).
     - **⚠️ NUMERAL-REPRESENTATION subtlety (found lap 136):** the step succedent is `F(numeral i ^+ 𝟏)`
       (`^+ = qqAdd`, `𝟏 = numeral 1`); the next premise's antecedent / the conclusion needs `F(numeral (i+1))`.
       `numeral_succ_pos` (`0<n → numeral(n+1) = numeral n ^+ 𝟏`) makes these match for `i>0`, but at `i=0`
       `numeral 0 ^+ 𝟏 = 𝟎 ^+ 𝟏 ≠ 𝟏 = numeral 1` — a syntactic boundary mismatch. So the telescoping cut
       formulas align via `^+ 𝟏` (successor), NOT the `numeral` shortcut. The Ind term `t = π₂ at'` of the
       reduced node must be the successor-tower `𝟎 ^+ 𝟏 ^+ … ^+ 𝟏` (k ones) for the exit to match `F(t)` —
       a constraint to thread through M2's Ind-node setup (or substitute the successor-tower term, not `numeral i`).
     - **NEXT (the validity):** the antecedent analog `seqAnt (fstIdx (zsubst d1 (π₁ at') t)) ∋ F(t)` +
       `= seqAnt s` (eigenvar/Γ freshness `fvSubstSeq (π₁ at') t (seqAnt s) = seqAnt s`), the base/exit/rank
       feeds, then assemble `zKValidF_iIndReductSeqG` via `isChainInf_telescope` + per-premise conjuncts
       (`iperm`/tag-UFormula from `ZDerivation_zsubst` of each premise). Then the OLD plan:
       `zKValidF_iIndReductSeqG : ZDerivation (zInd s at' p d0 d1) → seqSucc s = substs1 (numeral k) p →
         zKValidF s (irk p) (iIndReductSeqG d0 d1 (π₁ at') k)` (or with `k` = decoded value of `t`). Apply
       `isChainInf_telescope`: feed `chainAsucc`/`chainAnt` of `iIndReductSeqG` via the znth read-outs +
       `zIndWff` (base `F(0)`, step `F(a)→F(a+1)`) + `zsubst` end-sequent lemmas (`fstIdx_zsubst`,
       `seqAnt_fvSubstSeqt`, `seqSucc_fvSubstSeqt`, `seqSucc_zsubst_zIall_premise`-style). KEY remaining math:
       the telescoping `chainAsucc (·) i = F(i)` ⟹ `chainAnt (·) (i+1) = Γ,F(i)` requires
       `seqSucc (zsubst d1 a (numeral i)) = substs1 (numeral (i+1)) p` and `F(i) ∈ seqAnt (zsubst d1 a (numeral i))`
       — i.e. the substituted step's end-sequent. Then the per-premise iperm/UFormula conjuncts (from
       `ZDerivation_zsubst`-derivability of each premise) finish `zKValidF`. After validity: re-key
       `iRInd`/`red_zInd` to `iIndReductSeqG` at `k = value of t`, and ripple-fix the descent infra
       (the substituted-block fold `ω^{õd1}·k ⊕ ω^{õd0}` — `iotil_zsubst` keeps each step's `õ = õd1`).
2. **Alternative (cheaper, if the orbit is Ind-free):** investigate whether the regular ⊥-orbit
   (`ZDerivesEmptyR`) is or can be made **Ind-free** (tag-3 absent from the tree), discharging tag-3 by VACUITY
   in both `redSoundGen` and `descent_step_K_majorIdx`. Pushes the induction realization upstream to M2's
   `foundation_bot_to_Z_empty` (PA-induction → chain at embedding). M2-adjacent; check feasibility before M1b commit.
3. **Parallel M1b-term piece (unblocked):** `descent_step_K_majorIdx`'s **tag-5/6** (principal cut via banked
   `majorPrem_zAx{All,Neg}_cutPartner` + the shared `hAll` bridge) and **tag-4** (structural `<`-recursion) do
   NOT depend on the Ind reduct. These remain the genuine open content and are attackable now.

### What this lap proved (sorry-free, green)
- `isChainInf_iIndReduct_exit` (Crux2Blueprint, after :81) — pure chain combinatorics: the length-2 reduct's
  validity forces a premise succedent = `seqSucc s` or `⊥`.
- `zKValidF_iIndReduct_forces_degenerate` — with `zIndWff`, the term-degeneracy constraint = the refutation.
- `zKValidF_iIndReduct_of_zInd` STAYS a `sorry` (it is false; left in place as the interface marker with a
  ⚠️ OBSTRUCTION doc block pointing here). Do NOT attack it as stated — fix the reduct (attack 1) instead.

## lap 135 — ✅ existence-form PIVOT **PORTED TO SRC**: monolithic `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` DECOMPOSED
**Build 🟢 1326. Headline axiom footprint UNCHANGED** (`[propext, sorryAx, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` —
faithful, no new axioms). Ran the operator-mandated lap-132 existence-form spike to decision (PIVOT), then
ported the decomposition into `src/GoodsteinPA/Crux2Blueprint.lean`:

- **`false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` is NO LONGER a sorry** — it is a sorry-FREE composition of the existence step
  (E') `ZDerivesEmptyR_descent_step` with `prwo_forbids_existence_descent`.
- **(E') `ZDerivesEmptyR_descent_step` PROVEN** modulo the K case: Ind root proven (`iord_descent_red_zInd`),
  K root reduces to `descent_step_K_majorIdx`.
- **NEW named sub-`sorry` #1 `descent_step_K_majorIdx`** (Crux2Blueprint:1398) — the per-step K-case math
  (tag-3 descent proven; tag-5/6 = cutPartner principal cut + hAll; tag-4 = structural recursion).
- **NEW named sub-`sorry` #2 `prwo_forbids_existence_descent`** (Crux2Blueprint:1430) — the M3 PRWO plumbing.
- **SORRY-FREE infrastructure landed in src:** `iRedDescent_zK_replace_explicit` + `iord_descent_zK_replace_explicit`
  (index-generic `red`-free REPLACE descent kernel, works at `majorIdx`) + `descent_K_majorIdx_Ind_descends`
  (tag-3 Ind-major descent).

**Net src count 11 → 12** (the monolithic `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` split into 2 named sub-sorries). Per the
lap-135 DIRECTION update this is PROGRESS, not regress — a monolithic sorry is worse than named, individually-
attackable ones. `wip/ExistenceEndgame.lean` REMOVED (content now in src, verified green). The lap-132 spike
`descent_step_Kcrit_of_bundle` exploration is preserved in git history (commit 8f77bb3..d2f8610).

### VERDICT (why PIVOT) — precise scoping derived from the actual code
The spike's question was whether the existence / least-descending-reduct form **sheds** or merely **relocates**
the stall. Answer (derived from the actual code, not the lap-132 hope):

**What it BUYS (real):**
- Removes the BLOCKING "fixpoint ⟹ cut-free" obstruction (the lap-129 refutation that forced laps 120-131).
  In the existence form a fixpoint = "no descending reduct", and (E') makes that impossible on the ⊥-orbit.
- Removes the requirement that `red` be a TOTAL DETERMINISTIC Σ₁ function with a faithful selector threaded
  through the whole orbit + every invariant fold. (E') needs only ONE-SHOT `∃` per node.
- **The critical/non-critical split DISSOLVES into one selector `majorIdx`.** `firstBotPrem`/
  `majorIdx_botOrbit_reducible`/`majorPrem_zAx{All,Neg}_cutPartner` (ALL BANKED) survive only as one-shot
  `∃`-facts, NOT as a threaded engine. `majorIdx` never stalls on the ⊥-orbit (no leaf, `zTag ∉ {0,7}`).

**What it KEEPS (does NOT shed — the genuine residual):**
- The `hAll` cutFormula bridge (`seqSucc sⱼ = cutFormula`) — needed for tag-5/6 principal-cut soundness AND
  the critical case. SHARED with the engine route (lap-134 was already on it). The reframe does NOT avoid it.
- The **tag-4 structural RECURSION** — relocated from "prove `red` total+descending" to a `<`-induction on
  the derivation (premise `dⱼ < zK s r ds`). Genuinely open: the generalized IH must cover a premise with
  NON-EMPTY antecedent (chain threading), so plain `ZDerivesEmptyR` IH does not apply. This is the deep core.
- `prwo_forbids_existence_descent` — M3 plumbing, needed either way.

### Decomposition LANDED in `src/GoodsteinPA/Crux2Blueprint.lean` (the concrete PIVOT form, now in src)
`ZDerivesEmptyR_descent_step` (E') is now **PROVEN modulo one named lemma** (the reduction is real, no sorry):
- Ind (tag 3) → `⟨red d, ZDerivesEmptyR_red, iord_descent_red_zInd⟩`, PROVEN.
- K (tag 4) → reduces cleanly to **`descent_step_K_majorIdx`** (the lone math residual).
`false_of_ZDerivesEmpty_existence` = sorry-FREE composition of (E') + `prwo_forbids_existence_descent`.

**✅ also landed (SORRY-FREE, in the spike):** `iRedDescent_zK_replace_explicit` + `iord_descent_zK_replace_explicit`
— the index-generic, `red`-free REPLACE descent kernel. `iRedDescent_red_zK_replace_eq` (`RedZKDescent:334`)
proves the same bundle but keys its conclusion to `red (zK s r ds)` via an `hred` true only at `permIdx`; the
existence form picks the major premise at `majorIdx`, so it needs the descent over the EXPLICIT reduct
`zK s r (seqUpdate ds i v)`. Proof = the kernel body with `red (znth ds i) ↦ v`, final `rw [hred]` dropped
(`iotil`/`idg` are conclusion-label & `red`-agnostic). **This is the TERMINATION half of `descent_step_K_majorIdx`'s
tag-3 (and tag-4) replace cases** — ready to move to `src/RedZKDescent.lean` once a full
`descent_step_K_majorIdx` sub-case ports.

**✅ also landed (SORRY-FREE, in the spike):** `descent_K_majorIdx_Ind_descends` — the tag-3 (Ind major
premise) DESCENT, assembled from `red_zInd` + `iRedDescent_zInd` (banked) + the explicit kernel above. So
**`descent_step_K_majorIdx`'s tag-3 case is now reduced to PURELY the soundness witness** (`ZDerivesEmptyR`
of `zK s r (seqUpdate ds majorIdx (red dⱼ))`), which routes to `zKValidF_iIndReduct_of_zInd`
(Crux2Blueprint:79) + replace-preservation. No `hAll`, no recursion — the whole termination half of tag-3
is DONE in-kernel.

**Honest blocker assessment (lap 135):** every remaining src sorry is a genuine wall — the SOUNDNESS nut
(`redSoundGen` + its 4 sub-sorries: `zKValidF_iIndReduct_of_zInd` = induction-elimination `isChainInf`;
`ZDerivation_red_zK_{crit,splice,nonRep}` = cut-elim soundness, `hAll`-blocked), the tag-4 RECURSION, M2,
M3. No single-lap src DROP is available: the termination STRUCTURE is settled but converting it to a dropped
sorry needs the soundness witnesses, which are themselves deep. `zKValidF_iIndReduct_of_zInd` is the most
tractable soundness entry (gates tag-3 + redSoundGen's Ind branch) but is the genuine Buchholz induction→
cut-chain reduction (establish `isChainInf s (irk p) ⟨d1,d0⟩` from `zIndWff`), not a quick win.
**Concrete next attack:** `zKValidF_iIndReduct_of_zInd` — build `isChainInf s (irk p) (iIndReductSeq d0 d1 1)`:
the `j0` exit is the `d0` base premise (succedent `F(0)`); threading routes `d1`'s step antecedent `F(at')`
to `d0`'s succedent; rank `irk p`. Banked support: `iseqReg_iIndReductSeq`/`zfresh_iIndReductSeq`/
`zSeqAnt_iIndReductSeq` (Zsubst) already handle the reg/fresh/seqAnt conjuncts.

`descent_step_K_majorIdx {s r ds}` (regular `∅→⊥` K-node ⟹ ∃ descending sound reduct) dispatches on the
major premise `dⱼ = znth ds (majorIdx (zK s r ds))`'s tag (∈{3,4,5,6}, BANKED via `majorIdx_botOrbit_reducible`):
- **tag 3 (Ind major)** — `replace`-at-`majorIdx`; descent via the INDEX-GENERIC kernel
  `iotil_zK_lt_replace`/`idg_zK_le_replace` + `iRedDescent_zInd`; soundness via the §5.2.2 wrapper
  (`ZDerivation_iCritAux_of`). **Likely-bankable — the next concrete attack (see below).**
- **tag 5/6 (∀/¬-axiom major)** — NOT a replace (`red dⱼ = dⱼ`): the PRINCIPAL CUT at `(i', majorIdx)` with
  `i'` the upstream R-intro PINNED by `majorPrem_zAx{All,Neg}_cutPartner` (BANKED). `iRKcCrit`-style;
  soundness = the shared `hAll` bridge, descent = banked `iord_descent_iRcritG_*`.
- **tag 4 (chain major)** — the relocated structural recursion (deep core, above).

### NEXT ATTACK (concrete, ordered)
1. **Prove `descent_step_K_majorIdx`'s tag-3 (Ind major) sub-case** as a real lemma — the bankable one
   (no `hAll`, no recursion). Construct the reduct `zK s' r (seqUpdate ds (majorIdx) (red dⱼ))`, prove its
   descent off the index-generic kernel and soundness off the §5.2.2 wrapper. ⚠️ Check the tp-permissibility
   of `dⱼ` at `majorIdx` (the wrapper needs it; Cor 2.1 gives it only for `permIdx` — derive afresh for
   `majorIdx`). This is a genuine sub-lemma of the crux.
2. Then tag-5/6 via `cutPartner` + the shared `hAll` (lap-134 sub-steps 1-2 below — still on-path).
3. Then the tag-4 structural recursion: state the GENERALIZED (E') over Z-derivations with non-empty
   antecedent (the chain threading), inducting on `<`. This is the deep core that both routes share.
4. M3 `prwo_forbids_existence_descent` (Crux2Blueprint:1430, now UNFORBIDDEN — spike decided): realize
   `redLeast` as the Σ₁ least-witness over (E')'s predicate, wire `gentzenDescentφ`/`prwoInstance` (reused
   `wip/GentzenCon`).
5. ✅ DONE (lap 135) — (E') + endgame composition ported to src; `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` proven.

## lap 134 (latest) — ✅ `hNeg` DROPPED from the soundness front; NEXT = `hAll` via `redZKReady` strengthening
**Build 🟢 1326.** `hNeg` removed from `ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_of_zKValid`/`_of_isChainInf`/`_botOrbit` — the I¬
antecedent shape + `Seq` are read off the redex premise by `zDerivation_zIneg_inv (hdi ▸ hmem _ hIlt)`
(destructure `⟨_, _, _, hSeqsi, hd0ant⟩`). **The soundness front now carries ONLY `hAll`.**

**TURNKEY NEXT — discharge `hAll` (`maxEigen d0 < a ∧ IsUFormula p ∧ seqSucc sⱼ = cutFormula`), two sub-steps:**
1. **Strengthen `redZKReady_of_zKValid`'s ∀-pair** (`InternalZ:8341`) to ALSO export
   `seqSucc sⱼ = cutFormula (zK s r ds) ∧ IsUFormula ℒₒᵣ p`. ALL pieces are ALREADY proven inside that proof
   (lines 8366-8387): `hpjp : pj = p`, `hsf : IsSemiformula 1 p` (→ `.isUFormula`), `hcut : cutFormula =
   substs1 (numeral (π₁(π₂(tp (znth ds redexJ))))) p`. The new `seqSucc sⱼ = cutFormula`:
   ```
   have haxinv := zDerivation_zAxAll_inv (hdj ▸ hZj)   -- haxinv.2.2 : seqSucc sⱼ = substs1 (numeral k') pj
   have hk : π₁ (π₂ (tp (znth ds (redexJ (zK s r ds))))) = k' := by rw [hdj, tp_zAxAll]; simp [isymLk]
   rw [haxinv.2.2, hcut, hk, hpjp]    -- both sides substs1 (numeral k') p
   ```
   Ripple: the `rcases hcase` consumer at `Crux2Blueprint:595` (`⟨sᵢ,sⱼ,a,p,pj,k',d0, hdi, hdj, _hirk⟩`) +
   the one at `InternalZ:9346` gain 2 binders. Then in the all-case `hsj`/`hpwff` come from `hcase` directly,
   so **`hAll` shrinks to `maxEigen d0 < a` only.**
2. **Thread `ZRegular` to kill the `maxEigen` remainder.** `hAll`'s `maxEigen d0 < a` needs regularity (it is
   NOT in `zIallWff` — `zIallWff` has `seqAnt/seqSucc(fstIdx d0)` + `IsSemiformula 1 p`, no eigen bound). Add
   `hZReg : ZRegular (zK s r ds)` to the soundness front (the ⊥-orbit has it via `ZDerivesEmptyR.2.1`); derive
   `maxEigen d0 < a` from `ZRegular_zK_premise hds hZReg hIlt` then `ZRegular (zIall …) → maxEigen d0 < a`
   (pattern at `Crux2Blueprint:1077-1079`: `rw [ZRegular, zReg_zIall]; ltFlag_eq_zero_iff.mp …`). Then **drop
   `hAll` entirely** — the soundness front (`ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_botOrbit`) becomes hypothesis-free (modulo
   `hthread`/`hrank`, which are the `isChainInf` tip data), ready to assemble into `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty`
   or the existence form.

## lap 134 (late) — ✅ ZPhi `zIneg`-disjunct STRENGTHENED with `zInegAntWff` (I¬ exact-shape; the `hNeg` residual)
**Build 🟢 1326, footprint unchanged (no new axioms).** Wired the exact I¬ premise-antecedent shape into the
fixpoint skeleton, mirroring the lap-130/131 `zAxAllSuccWff` precedent:
- **`zInegAntWff s p d0 := Seq (seqAnt s) ∧ seqAnt (fstIdx d0) = seqCons (seqAnt s) p`** — the `Seq` is
  BUNDLED (not separate) so the shape is SELF-PRESERVING under eigensubst. Updated its `…Def` semisentence
  (`!seqDef sa1` conjunct) + definability instance (`seq_defined.iff`).
- Added `∧ zInegAntWff s p d0` to: `ZPhi` (5365), `zphi_iff` (5415), `zblueprint` sigma (5469) + pi (5490),
  `zPhi_definable` simp (5513).
- **`zDerivation_zIneg_inv` now yields `zInegAntWff s p d0`** — so `hNeg`'s exact-shape eq
  `seqAnt (fstIdx d0) = seqCons (seqAnt sᵢ) p` IS NOW DERIVABLE by inversion (no longer a hypothesis to beg).
- **Preservation:** `ZDerivation_zsubst`'s zIneg case discharges the substituted `zInegAntWff` via
  `fvSubstSeq_seqCons hSeqs` (Seq from the bundle) + `fvSubstSeq_seq` (new node's Seq free). Note: anon-ctor
  flattening only works at the TAIL — `zInegWff` is now a left-child, so it must be bundled `⟨?_,?_,?_⟩`.
- Projection ripple `.2.2 → .1.2.2` at the 5 zIneg-wff sites (`iperm_tp_zsubst`, `tp_zsubst_eq`,
  `tag_uformula`-style, `tp_isymR_form_wff`); inversion-consumer destructures `⟨…, ⟨hbot,hmem,hp⟩, _, _⟩`
  at Crux2Blueprint 234/881.

**RESIDUAL after this — only the `hAll` (zAxAll) half remains** of the two exact-shape ZPhi facts:
- `hAll` needs `seqSucc sⱼ = cutFormula (zK s r ds)`. `zDerivation_zAxAll_inv` already yields
  `zAxAllSuccWff sⱼ pj k' = (seqSucc sⱼ = substs1 (numeral k') pj)`. **GAP:** bridge
  `cutFormula (zK s r ds) = substs1 (numeral k') pj` — the cut formula equals the SELECTED axiom instance
  (Buchholz §3.2 case 5.1 `cutFormula_all`, the critical-pair principality from `zKValid`). THE next target.
- `hNeg`'s exact-shape eq is now FREE (this lap) — so `ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_*`'s `hNeg` hypothesis can be
  discharged at any call site by `(zDerivation_zIneg_inv (premise)).2.2.2`.
**NEXT:** discharge `hNeg` fully at the botOrbit call site from the inversion, then attack the `hAll`
cut-formula/instance bridge (`cutFormula_all`). Then both per-node bundles are free and the soundness front
(`ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_botOrbit`) is hypothesis-free → assemble into `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` / the existence
form. (Or pivot to `wip/ExistenceEndgame.lean` which consumes the same now-lighter bundle.)

## lap 134 — ✅ `ZSeqAnt` threaded + the `Seq(seqAnt·)` obligation DISCHARGED at the soundness front
**Build 🟢 1326, footprint unchanged.** Both lap-133 turnkey sub-steps LANDED:
1. **`ZDerivesEmptyR` now carries `∧ ZSeqAnt d`** (`Crux2Blueprint:1103`); `ZDerivesEmptyR_red` produces
   `ZSeqAnt (red d)` via the banked `ZSeqAnt_red d h.1.1 h.2.2.2`. No consumer relied on `.2.2` as `ZFresh`
   (the only `.2.2.2` hits are `tag_uformula` projections on a different object), so the tuple ripple was clean.
2. **The `Seq(seqAnt sⱼ)`/`Seq(seqAnt sᵢ)` conjuncts are GONE from `hAll`/`hNeg`.** Discharged at the SOURCE
   `ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_of_zKValid` (and propagated to `_of_isChainInf`, `_botOrbit`): each now takes
   `hZSeq : ZSeqAnt (zK s r ds)` and derives the two `Seq` facts internally via `seq_seqAnt_zK_premise`
   (`hds`/`hmem` from `zDerivation_zK_inv hZ`; both redex premises non-chain — `zAxAll` tag 5 / `zIneg`
   tag 2 ≠ 4 — via `rw [hdj/hdi]; simp`; `fstIdx_zAxAll`/`fstIdx_zIneg` rewrite `seqAnt (fstIdx ·)` to
   `seqAnt sⱼ/sᵢ`).

**RESIDUAL (the now-sole per-node blocker) = the EXACT-SHAPE ZPhi equalities** that `hAll`/`hNeg` still carry:
- `hAll`: `seqSucc sⱼ = cutFormula (zK s r ds)` (the ∀-axiom succedent IS the cut instance `F(k)`).
- `hNeg`: `seqAnt (fstIdx d0) = seqCons (seqAnt sᵢ) p` (the I¬ premise antecedent is exactly `Γ,p`).
These are the lap-130/131 **ZPhi-strengthening** target (`zAxAllSuccWff`/`zInegAntWff`): strengthen the loose
`zAxAll`/`zIneg` `ZPhi` disjuncts (currently only `inAnt`/membership) to the genuine axiom/rule shapes,
mirroring the lap-118 `zAxNeg` `A∈Γ` strengthening. NOTE the `zIneg` half's old `Seq (seqAnt sᵢ)` precondition
(lap-131's pinned blocker) is now FREE from the same `ZSeqAnt` fold — so that strengthening is unblocked on its
`Seq` side. **NEXT:** either (a) the ZPhi-strengthening for the engine-swap route, or (b) pivot to
`wip/ExistenceEndgame.lean` whose K-critical case `descent_step_Kcrit_of_bundle` consumes the same `hAll`/`hNeg`.

## lap 133 — ✅ `zSeqAnt` fold LANDED (the single shared `Seq(seqAnt)` blocker's core infra)
**Build 🟢 1326, sorry-free in `src/`, footprint unchanged.** Added to `Zsubst.lean` (after `zFresh_zsubst`,
before the corrected-reduct-premise regularity section): the full `Seq`-analogue of `zFresh`, threaded
additively (NOT in `ZPhi`). `zSeqAntNext`/`zSeqAntTable`/`zSeqAnt` + Δ₁ defs + structural correctness +
per-tag recursion eqns + `ZSeqAnt` + extraction (`seq_seqAnt_zK_premise` = the `Seq(seqAnt sⱼ)` supplier,
`zSeqAnt_zK_of`, `zSeqAnt_zK_premise_zero`, `zDerivation_pos`). Unlike `zFresh` (flag at I∀ only), the
head flag `seqAntSeqFlag (fstIdx d)` fires at EVERY node.

**NEXT (turnkey, two independent sub-steps):**
1. **Thread `ZSeqAnt` into `ZDerivesEmptyR`** (`Crux2Blueprint:1103`): add `∧ ZSeqAnt d` and prove
   `ZSeqAnt_red` (mirror `ZFresh_red`, `Zsubst:~2580-2780`: `ZSeqAnt_red_zK` via `zSeqAnt_zK_of` over the
   reduct premises + `Seq (seqAnt s)` of the conclusion — FREE on the ⊥-orbit, `seqAnt s = ∅`). Ripple:
   `ZDerivesEmptyR_red`, `redSound`, the `ZDerivesEmptyR_red_iterate` chain, M2 `foundation_bot_to_Z_empty`
   gains a `ZSeqAnt` conjunct.
2. **Discharge the `Seq` parts of `hAll`/`hNeg`** in `ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_botOrbit` (`Crux2Blueprint:648`)
   from `seq_seqAnt_zK_premise` (premise = redexJ/redexI node, both genuine `ZDerivation`s via
   `zDerivation_zK_inv`). The RESIDUAL after that = the exact-shape ZPhi facts `seqSucc sⱼ = cutFormula`
   (∀) and `seqAnt (fstIdx d0) = seqCons (seqAnt sᵢ) p` (¬) — a SEPARATE blocker (the lap-130/131
   ZPhi-strengthening, `zAxAllSuccWff`/`zInegAntWff`; `zIneg` half needs `Seq (seqAnt sᵢ)` which is now
   suppliable from this very fold via `seq_seqAnt_zK_premise`).

## Reflection — 2026-06-26 (lap 132, DEEP REFLECTION): the STALL is an engine-formulation artifact; course-TEST the existence form
**Build 🟢 1326. No proof code touched (reflection lap). Headline + faithfulness re-verified in-kernel; statement
re-audited vs source — no drift.** Primary deliverable `REFLECTION-2026-06-26-lap132.md`.

**Direction call.** Destination KEPT (axiom-free Kirby–Paris via crux-1 ∘ crux-2; the semantic shortcut is
refuted, lap 98; axiomatizing crux-2 is forbidden — so the honest endpoint is the built girder). crux-2's
diagnosis is converged and correct. **But the SELECTION/STALL sub-goal consuming laps 120→131 is an artifact
of the *fixed-deterministic-engine* formulation** (it exists only to make a permIdx-based `red` not stall, so
"fixpoint ⟹ cut-free" holds for the fixpoint branch of `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty`).

**KEEP doing:** per-reduct soundness (laps 112-119); the invariant folds (`zReg`/`zFresh`, and FINISH the
`seqAntSeq` fold — needed in BOTH formulations so the reduct stays in `ZDerivesEmptyR`); per-reduct descent
lemmas; green commits + honest sorries.

**STOP doing (pending the spike verdict):** sinking laps into the fixed-engine permIdx→`majorIdx` swap +
selection-correctness (`firstBotPrem_reducible`, the tag-5/6 dispatch) + the ZPhi exact-shape strengthenings
whose only consumer is that engine's soundness derivation. The existence form obviates them.

**HIGHEST-VALUE NEXT TARGET — `wip/ExistenceEndgame.lean` spike (decisive either way, mirror lap-101):**
- Define `redLeast(d)` := least `d'` with `[ ZDerivesEmptyR d' ∧ icmp (iord d') (iord d)=0 ∧ d' a cut-reduct
  of d ]`, else `d` (Σ₁ least-witness).
- State **(E)**: `ZDerivesEmptyR d ∧ ¬cutfree d ⟹ ∃ d', ZDerivesEmptyR d' ∧ iord d' ≺ iord d ∧ d' a cut-reduct
  of d`. Then "`redLeast d = d` ⟺ no descending reduct ⟹ `d` cut-free" is DEFINITIONAL.
- Assemble the existence-form `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty`: descend-while-cut + PRWO(ε₀) ⟹ reach a fixpoint ⟹
  cut-free ∅→⊥ ⟹ Cor 2.1 absurd. Signatures pinned against the real API; bodies sorried where banked lemmas
  plug in. Getting it to ELABORATE is the evidence.
- **(E) suppliers, all banked:** `zTag_Ind_or_K_of_ZDerivesEmpty` (`InternalZ:8636`); `iord_descent_iRKcCrit_corr`/
  `_neg` (`RedZKDescent:580/597`) + `ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_all`; `iord_descent_red_zInd` (`Crux2Blueprint:1116`);
  Cor 2.1 (`tp_selected_isymRep_of_emptyAnt_botSucc`, `InternalZ:7684`); `iRcrit_descends_or_zInd_zK_premise`
  (`RedZKDescent:734`, ≈ (E) at the root).
- **Decision rule:** (E) closes cleanly ⟹ PIVOT, drop the stall campaign. (E) re-imports the stall (the
  real-cut-vs-structurally-cut-free determination IS the redex-finding) ⟹ fall back to the lap-129 swap with
  that evidence (NEXT_STEPS keeps it as the FALLBACK route; its facts all still valid).

**✅ SPIKE LANDED (this lap) — `wip/ExistenceEndgame.lean` elaborates (exit 0; `lake build GoodsteinPA` still
green 1326).** Three declarations: `ZDerivesEmptyR_descent_step` (E', **Ind case PROVEN** from banked
`ZDerivesEmptyR_red` + `iord_descent_red_zInd`; K case sorried = the single remaining math content);
`prwo_forbids_existence_descent` (reused M3 plumbing, sorried); `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty_existence`
(**sorry-FREE** 1-line composition — contrast the current bare-sorry `Crux2Blueprint.false_of_ZDerivesEmpty`).
**Verdict so far:** the endgame assembly is trivial and the Ind case is free, so the existence form provably
sheds the dichotomy + fixpoint-branch. **Key honest finding the spike forced out:** the iterator MUST be
`𝚺₁`-definable (`redLeast` least-witness, NOT classical choice) — `iord` is not internally well-founded in
nonstandard `V`, so PRWO forbids only `𝚺₁` descents; that `𝚺₁`-ness lives inside `prwo_forbids_existence_descent`.
**NEXT (in the spike):** discharge (E')'s K-critical sub-case (`iRKcCrit` assembly, gap = lap-131 `Seq(seqAnt)`
fold) then the K-non-critical sub-case (major premise via `firstBotPrem_reducible`) — the decisive test of
whether the existence form sheds or merely relocates the stall combinatorics.

**Honest caveat (do not over-sell):** the redex-pair combinatorics survive in the existence form (as a one-shot
`∃`, not a total function threaded through the orbit + every fold). The spike TESTS whether (E) is clean at the
root; it is not a declared win.

---

## lap 131 — the lap-130 "turnkey/self-healing" ZPhi-strengthening plan is INCOMPLETE: the `zsubst`-transfer needs TWO un-recorded invariants. Substrate `fvSubstSeq_seqCons` LANDED
**Build 🟢 1326.** Landed (axiom-clean `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`, additive, `Zsubst.lean` after
`inAnt_fvSubstSeq`): **`fvSubstSeq_seqCons`** — `fvSubstSeq a t (Γ ⁀' A) = (fvSubstSeq a t Γ) ⁀' (fvSubst a t A)`
for `Seq Γ` (positional `Seq.lh_ext` proof; `lt_succ_iff_le`, `znth_seqCons_of_lt/self`).

**⭐ FINDING (corrects lap-130's NEXT plan; verified by attempting the full atomic change, then reverting):**
The lap-130 "TURNKEY ZPhi-STRENGTHENING PLAN" claims the construction sites are **SELF-HEALING** ("they
reconstruct from the same disjunct they destructured via the inversion"). **That is FALSE for
`ZDerivation_zsubst`** (`Zsubst.lean:~2890`), which is a genuine SECOND constructor of `zIneg`/`zAxAll`
`ZDerivation`s: it rebuilds the disjunct from *substituted* data (`fvSubstSeqt a t s`, `fvSubst a t p`,
`zsubst d0 a t`), NOT via inversion. So strengthening the `zIneg`/`zAxAll` `ZPhi` disjuncts forces
`ZDerivation_zsubst` to PROVE the new conjuncts for the substituted node — and each needs an invariant the
current `ZPhi` skeleton does NOT record:

- **`zInegAntWff s p d0 := seqAnt (fstIdx d0) = seqCons (seqAnt s) p`** transfers iff `fvSubstSeq` commutes
  with `seqCons` — which is `fvSubstSeq_seqCons` (LANDED) but it **needs `Seq (seqAnt s)`**. And `seqAnt q :=
  π₁ q` is NOT structurally a `Seq` (verified `InternalZ:967`); `Seq (seqAnt …)` is a separately-THREADED
  invariant (cf. `Seq_seqAnt_seqAddAnt`, `InternalZ:1057`) the `ZPhi` skeleton never carries. So the
  `zInegAntWff` strengthening additionally requires threading `Seq (seqAnt s)` through `ZPhi` (a new
  `seqWffFlag`-style fold, OR add `Seq (seqAnt s)` as a disjunct conjunct + supply it at every `zIneg`
  constructor). **zIneg is the genuinely blocked half.**
- **`zAxAllSuccWff s p k := seqSucc s = substs1 (numeral k) p`** transfers iff `fvSubst` commutes with
  `substs1 (numeral k)` — that is `fvSubst_substs1` (`FvSubst:581`) + `termFvSubst_numeral` (`Zsubst:205`),
  but `fvSubst_substs1` **needs `IsSemiformula ℒₒᵣ 1 p`**, NOT the `IsUFormula ℒₒᵣ p` the `zAxAll` disjunct
  records. The faithful Buchholz `Ax^{∀p,k}` matrix IS a 1-formula (exactly like `zIallWff` carries
  `IsSemiformula 1 p` "the `ZDerivation_zsubst` commutations consume it", `InternalZ:1613`). So strengthen
  the `zAxAll` disjunct's formula-hood `IsUFormula ℒₒᵣ p → IsSemiformula ℒₒᵣ 1 p` (arith
  `!(isUFormula ℒₒᵣ).sigma p → !(isSemiformula ℒₒᵣ).sigma 1 p`); then `ZDerivation_zsubst`'s `hp` IS the
  `IsSemiformula 1` it needs (**self-supplied** — `zAxAll` is completable), and `IsSemiformula 1 →`
  `.isUFormula` heals the ~15 downstream `IsUFormula`-consumers. **zAxAll is the completable half.**

**Backed-up WIP (re-applies the full plumbing minus the two blocked obligations):**
`scratchpad/lap131-zphi-strengthening-WIP.diff` (342 lines): the complete, CORRECT ZPhi ripple —
`ZPhi`/`zphi_iff`/`zblueprint` Σ/Π/`zPhi_definable` simp, `zphi_monotone`/`zphi_strong_finite`, the 8 raw
`zDerivation_iff.mp` destructure fixups (only the ones NAMING the last conjunct break; trailing-`_`-absorb
sites are unaffected), `zDerivation_zIneg_inv`/`zDerivation_zAxAll_inv` returning the new conjunct + their
5-tuple/`.2`-projection consumers, and the `+ zAxAllSuccWffDef`/`+ zInegAntWffDef` building blocks already in
`InternalZ.lean:1559/1589`. The diff builds InternalZ green; it goes red ONLY at `ZDerivation_zsubst`'s two
new obligations (the Seq/IsSemiformula gaps above) — that is the whole residual.

**NEXT (decomposed, by risk):**
1. ✅ **zAxAll DONE (this lap, build 🟢 1326, headline footprint unchanged):** the `zAxAll` `ZPhi` disjunct
   now carries `IsSemiformula ℒₒᵣ 1 p ∧ inAnt (^∀p)(seqAnt s) ∧ zAxAllSuccWff s p k` (formula-hood
   `IsUFormula → IsSemiformula 1`, arith `!(isSemiformula ℒₒᵣ).sigma/pi 1 p` + `!(zAxAllSuccWffDef.sigma/pi)`).
   `zDerivation_zAxAll_inv` now returns all three (recovers `k` via `zAxAllK`). `ZDerivation_zsubst`'s zAxAll
   obligation discharged: `seqSucc_fvSubstSeqt ▸ hsucc ▸ fvSubst_substs1 ht (by simp) hp ▸ termFvSubst_numeral`
   (`hp` IS the `IsSemiformula 1` it needs — self-supplied, as predicted). The ~7 downstream `IsUFormula`
   consumers healed with `.isUFormula`; Crux2 construction sites SELF-HEALED via the strengthened inversion.
   `zPhi_definable`'s simp closed with just `+ zAxAllSuccWff_defined.iff` (the raw `isSemiformula` resolved
   automatically, same as `isUFormula` did). So `hAll`'s `seqSucc sⱼ = cutFormula` (∀-side) is now derivable
   from `zKValid` + `zDerivation_zAxAll_inv`. **zIneg (hNeg, ¬-side) is the only remaining gate.**
2. **THE SHARED BLOCKER (refines the lap-130 plan, verified by reading `Crux2Blueprint:584-663`): a
   `Seq (seqAnt)` invariant on chain premise nodes.** The hypothesis-free `botOrbit'` must DERIVE `hAll`
   AND `hNeg`, and BOTH bundles require not only the exact-shape equalities but also **`Seq (seqAnt sⱼ)`**
   (hAll, the ∀-axiom node) / **`Seq (seqAnt sᵢ)`** (hNeg, the I-rule premise node) of the chain redex
   premises (`sⱼ = fstIdx (znth ds redexJ)`, `sᵢ = fstIdx (znth ds redexI)`). So even hAll — whose
   exact-shape `seqSucc sⱼ = cutFormula` IS now derivable (step 1) — is NOT yet fully dischargeable: its
   `Seq (seqAnt sⱼ)` half is missing. `Seq (seqAnt s)` is NOT a `ZDerivation` consequence (the `zAtom`/`zAx1`
   base disjuncts never record it; `seqAnt q := π₁ q` is not structurally a `Seq`). So it needs a tracked
   invariant — the `Seq` analogue of `seqWffFlag` (lap 127).
   - ✅ **BUILDING BLOCK BANKED (this lap, axiom-clean, `𝚺₁`-definable, `Zsubst.lean` after `seqWffFlag`):**
     **`seqAntSeqFlag s`** := `if Seq (seqAnt s) then 0 else 1` + `seqAntSeqFlagDef`/`_defined`/`_definable`
     + `seqAntSeqFlag_eq_zero_iff`. The per-node flag the eventual derivation-fold maxes over.
   - **NEXT (the fold):** mirror `ZFresh`'s `freshFlag` machinery (lap 126/127) — a `seqAntSeqFold d` that
     maxes `seqAntSeqFlag (fstIdx ·)` over the derivation tree (= 0 ⟹ every node antecedent is a `Seq`),
     proved preserved by `red`/`iRcrit` (each rule's antecedent op `seqAddAnt`/`seqSetSucc`/identity
     preserves `Seq` — `Seq_seqAnt_seqAddAnt` `InternalZ:1057` exists), and threaded into `ZDerivesEmptyR`
     like `ZFresh`/`ZRegular`. At the ⊥-orbit ROOT `seqAnt s = ∅` (Seq trivially), and the fold gives
     `Seq (seqAnt)` for every chain premise ⟹ supplies `hSeqsj`/`hSeqsi`.
3. **zIneg exact-shape (the seqCons equality), once the Seq fold lands:** re-apply the `zInegAntWff` half of
   `scratchpad/lap131-zphi-strengthening-WIP.diff`; discharge `ZDerivation_zsubst`'s zIneg obligation with
   `fstIdx_zsubst ▸ seqAnt_fvSubstSeqt ▸ hant ▸ fvSubstSeq_seqCons hSeq` where `hSeq : Seq (seqAnt s)` comes
   from reconstructing `ZDerivation (zIneg s p d0)` + the Seq fold (`fvSubstSeq_seq` makes the substituted
   antecedent a `Seq` automatically, so the produced node self-satisfies the flag).
4. Then `hAll`/`hNeg` derivable ⟹ hypothesis-free `botOrbit'` (lap-130 step 6); LEFT soundness real; tag-4
   RIGHT recursion + `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` PRWO wiring remain.

## lap 130 — the `majorIdx` re-key plan is INCOMPLETE: tag-5/6 major premises stall too; cut-partner PINNED
**Build 🟢 1326.** Landed (axiom-clean `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`, additive, `InternalZ.lean` after
`majorIdx_botOrbit_reducible`): **`majorPrem_zAxAll_cutPartner`** + **`majorPrem_zAxNeg_cutPartner`**.

**⭐ FINDING (refines/corrects the lap-129 re-key plan):** the lap-129 plan "re-key `iRK`'s replace branch
`permIdx ↦ majorIdx`, atom/`Ax¹` stall now unreachable" is **INCOMPLETE**. `majorIdx_botOrbit_reducible`
excludes only tag-0/7 (atom/`Ax¹`) from the major-premise slot — but **tags 5/6 (`zAxAll`/`zAxNeg`,
L-axioms) are ALSO `red`-FIXPOINTS** (`red_zAxAll = id`, `red_zAxNeg = id`, `InternalZ:7374,7377`). They are
NOT excluded because `chainAsucc_threaded_of_leaf` keys on *succedent*-in-own-antecedent, but the L-axiom
inversions (`zDerivation_zAxAll_inv`/`_zAxNeg_inv`) put the *active* L-formula (`^∀ p` / `inegF p`), not the
succedent, in the antecedent. So a naive `replace`-recursion into a tag-5/6 major premise `dⱼ` STALLS exactly
like the atom case (`red dⱼ = dⱼ`, no descent).

**The fix (faithful Buchholz §14.253):** a tag-5/6 major premise is the L-redex of the principal CUT, not a
`replace` target. Its active L-formula threads back (via `isChainInf`) to a STRICTLY EARLIER R-introduction
premise. The two new lemmas PIN that R-partner:
- `majorPrem_zAxAll_cutPartner`: `dⱼ = zAxAll _ p k` ⟹ `∃ i' < majorIdx, chainAsucc ds i' = ^∀ p` (the
  R-intro `zIall` of `∀p`).
- `majorPrem_zAxNeg_cutPartner`: `dⱼ = zAxNeg _ p` ⟹ `∃ i' < majorIdx, chainAsucc ds i' = inegF p` (the
  R-intro `zIneg` of `¬p`).
So the re-keyed `iRK` dispatch on `majorIdx` must route tag-5/6 ⟹ CRITICAL/splice (cut against the upstream
R-partner `i'`), tag-3/4 ⟹ replace/recurse (`red_zInd` descends; `zK` recurses). Tags 0,1,2,7 are excluded
(0,7 = `majorIdx_botOrbit_reducible`; 1,2 = succedent is an R-principal formula ≠ ⊥).

**⭐ SECONDARY FINDING (eases the eventual swap):** the descent lemmas `iRedDescent_red_zK_replace_eq` /
`iord_descent_red_zK_replace_eq` / `_splice_eq` (`RedZKDescent.lean:334,363,380,401`) are **index-generic** —
they take `(hred : red (zK s r ds) = zK s' r (seqUpdate ds i (red (znth ds i))))` for an ARBITRARY `i`, NOT
hardwired to `permIdx`. So the re-key's per-case descent WORK transfers verbatim from `permIdx` to `majorIdx`;
the atomic change is confined to (a) `iRK` def + `iRKDef` arith, (b) the reduct-computation lemmas
`red_zK_rep`/`red_zK_rep_nonchain`/`red_zK_splice` (`InternalZ:7387+`), (c) the `iord_descent_red` case split
(now on `majorIdx`-selected tags, with the tag-5/6 critical dispatch above). The 365 `permIdx` mentions are
mostly selection-property lemmas mirrored by the already-banked `majorIdxAux_*` family.

**✅ NEXT-(1) DONE — `majorPrem_tag_mem`** (`InternalZ.lean`, axiom-clean): on a `∅→⊥` chain, the major
premise tag ∈ {3,4,5,6}. Excludes 0,7 (`majorIdx_botOrbit_reducible`) and now 1,2 (a `zIall`/`zIneg` node's
succedent is `^∀p`/`inegF p ≠ ^⊥`, but the major premise's succedent IS `^⊥`). Helpers `qqAll_ne_falsum` /
`inegF_ne_falsum` banked. This is the exact tag dichotomy the re-keyed `iRK` dispatch case-splits on.

**⭐ KEY RECONCILIATION (this lap) — the lap-124 dichotomy is the path; its RIGHT disjunct = the major
premise.** Re-reading `RedZKDescent.lean`: lap 124 ALREADY banked `iRcrit_descends_or_nonleaf_isymRep`
(`:194`) — for ANY regular `∅→⊥` chain: **either** `iRcrit (zK s r ds) (zAxReduct∘red)` strictly
`iord`-descends (LEFT, stall-tolerant, NO `permIdx`/`red`-fixpoint dependence — via
`iord_descent_iRcrit_botChain_leaves` + `inference_critical_pair_of_botChain`), **or** there is a NON-LEAF
`isymRep` premise (RIGHT). The lap-129 "DEAD END" verdict was about dissolving the RIGHT via *reroute* — but
the RIGHT is not dissolved, it is RECURSED. New lemma **`isymRep_nonleaf_zInd_or_zK`** (this lap, axiom-clean):
the four `isymRep`-carrying constructors are `zAtom`/`zInd`/`zK`/`zAx1` (`tp_z*`), so a non-leaf `isymRep`
premise is precisely a **`zInd` (tag 3)** or **`zK` (tag 4)** — i.e. EXACTLY `majorPrem_tag_mem`'s tag-3/4
cases (a ⊥-exit `zInd`/`zK` IS a non-leaf `isymRep`). So the endgame dispatch is now fully tag-explicit:
- LEFT (all `isymRep` premises are leaves) → `iRcrit` descends (banked).
- RIGHT, tag 3 (`zInd`) → `red_zInd` / `iord_descent_red_zInd` strict descent (banked).
- RIGHT, tag 4 (`zK`) → the genuine residual: recurse into the sub-⊥-chain premise.
Tags 5/6 (L-axioms, `isymLk`) are NOT `isymRep` — they live in the LEFT redex (cut), partner pinned by
`majorPrem_zAxAll/zAxNeg_cutPartner`.

**✅ ENTRY POINT BANKED — `iRcrit_descends_or_zInd_zK_premise`** (`RedZKDescent.lean` end, axiom-clean): for a
regular ⊥-orbit chain, **either** `iRcrit` strictly `iord`-descends, **or** there is a `zInd`/`zK` premise.
This is the clean tag-explicit entry the restructured `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` consumes (combines the lap-124
`iRcrit_descends_or_nonleaf_isymRep` with `isymRep_nonleaf_zInd_or_zK`).

**⚠️ REMAINING DEEP RESIDUALS (both gate the LEFT and tag-4 paths — the genuine multi-lap walls):**
- **LEFT soundness:** `iRcrit (zK s r ds) (zAxReduct∘red)` must be a `ZDerivation` to iterate. This is
  `ZDerivation_red_zK_crit` (`Crux2Blueprint:655`), FALSE as stated under the current `ρ` (instance-0 vs k),
  fixed post-engine-swap by `ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_of_zKValid` (`:575`, PROVEN modulo its plumbing
  `hAll`/`hNeg`/`hthread`/`hrank`/`hCwff`/`hSeqs`). Supplying that plumbing from the orbit (`zKValid`+`ZFresh`)
  is the lap-128 "extract-everything-from-isChainInf" unit. **PLUMBING PROGRESS (lap 130):**
  - ✅ `hCwff` DONE — **`cutFormula_wff_of_zKValid`** (`InternalZ.lean`, axiom-clean): `IsUFormula
    (cutFormula (zK s r ds))` from `ZDerivation`+`zKValid` (∀-redex `substs1` of the I∀ premise's
    1-semiformula; ¬-redex matrix directly).
  - ✅ `hSeqs` DONE (⊥-orbit) — `seqAnt s = ∅` ⟹ `seq_empty`. Packaged with `hCwff` into the entry
    **`ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_botOrbit`** (`Crux2Blueprint.lean`, axiom-clean): the re-keyed critical reduct's
    soundness on a ⊥-orbit, residual surface reduced to just `hAll`/`hNeg`/`hthread`/`hrank`.
  - ⚠️ **THE PRECISE REMAINING OBSTRUCTION (verified this lap):** the per-node facts `hAll`'s `seqSucc sⱼ =
    cutFormula` (∀-axiom succedent = cut instance `F(k)`) and `hNeg`'s `seqAnt (fstIdx d0) = seqCons
    (seqAnt sᵢ) p` (I¬ premise antecedent = exactly `Γ,p`) are EXACT-SHAPE equalities. The current loose
    `zAxAll`/`zIneg` `ZPhi` disjuncts carry only `inAnt`/membership (`zDerivation_zAxAll_inv` gives `∀p∈Γ`
    NOT `seqSucc=F(k)`; `zInegWff` gives `inAnt p` NOT the seqCons antecedent), so these are NOT derivable
    from `zKValid`. **FIX (next): strengthen the `zAxAll` ZPhi disjunct to carry `seqSucc s = substs1
    (numeral k) p` and the `zIneg`/`zInegWff` to carry `seqAnt (fstIdx d0) = seqCons (seqAnt s) p`** — the
    genuine axiom/rule shapes, mirroring the lap-118 `zAxNeg` `A∈Γ` strengthening (one ZPhi disjunct +
    inversion + arithmetization + the intro/`of` call sites). This is a contained ZPhi-ripple, NOT new deep
    machinery. `hthread`/`hrank` + `redexJ ≤ j0` (free if `j0 = lh ds − 1`, `isChainInf_of_last`) remain.
  - ✅ **BUILDING BLOCKS BANKED (lap 130, axiom-clean, `𝚫₁`-definable):** **`zAxAllSuccWff s p k`** :=
    `seqSucc s = substs1 (numeral k) p` (the ∀-axiom succedent shape) + **`zInegAntWff s p d0`** :=
    `seqAnt (fstIdx d0) = seqCons (seqAnt s) p` (the I¬ premise-antecedent shape), each with its
    `…Def : 𝚫₁.Semisentence 3` and `…_defined`/`…_definable` instance (`InternalZ.lean`, after
    `zInegWff_definable`). These are the exact predicates to splice into the ZPhi disjuncts.
  - **TURNKEY ZPhi-STRENGTHENING PLAN (next lap, atomic):**
    1. `ZPhi` (`InternalZ:5310/5307`): zAxAll disjunct `… ∧ inAnt (^∀p)(seqAnt s) ∧ zAxAllSuccWff s p k`;
       zIneg disjunct `… ∧ zInegWff p d0 ∧ zInegAntWff s p d0`.
    2. `zblueprint` Σ/Π (`:5415/5435` zAxAll, `:5407/5427` zIneg): append `!(zAxAllSuccWffDef.sigma/pi) s p k`
       / `!(zInegAntWffDef.sigma/pi) s p d0`; add `zAxAllSuccWff_defined.iff`/`zInegAntWff_defined.iff` to the
       `zPhi_definable` simp (`:5446`).
    3. `zphi_iff` / `zDerivation_iff` both dirs (`:5319-5392`) + `zphi_monotone` (`:5317`) + the
       Construction-field destructures (`:5504/5529`): add the new conjunct to each `⟨s,p,k,rfl,hp,hin⟩` /
       `⟨s,p,d0,rfl,…⟩` pattern (mechanical `_`/`hnew`).
    4. `zDerivation_zAxAll_inv` / `zDerivation_zIneg_inv`: return the new conjunct.
    5. Construction sites (`ZDerivation_red` zAxAll/zIneg cases, `Crux2Blueprint:1089/1092`): supply the new
       conjunct — SELF-HEALING (they reconstruct from the same disjunct they destructured via the inversion).
    6. Then `hAll`/`hNeg` of `ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_botOrbit` become derivable from `redZKReady_of_zKValid` +
       the strengthened inversions ⟹ a hypothesis-free `ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_botOrbit'`.
- **RIGHT tag-4:** recurse into the sub-`zK`-chain — the chain-REPLACE strong induction (`iord_descent_red`
  sorry `Crux2Blueprint:1167`). Well-founded on premise `iord` < parent.

**NEXT (restructure `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` around the lap-124 dichotomy, NOT the `red`-orbit):** define the
⊥-orbit successor to apply `iRcrit` on the LEFT and, on the RIGHT, dispatch by `isymRep_nonleaf_zInd_or_zK`
(tag 3 → `red_zInd`; tag 4 → recurse into the major premise). The infinite `iord`-descent then has NO
fixpoint branch ⟹ feed PRWO(ε₀). Soundness side: `iRcrit` must preserve `ZDerivesEmptyR` (check
`ZDerivation_iRcrit*`/the `iRKc` soundness already banked). Residual = the tag-4 recursion's well-founded
measure (premise `iord` strictly below parent — the `iotil`/`idg` chain structure).

**(SUPERSEDED sub-plan) build the tag-5/6 critical reduct that cuts `dⱼ` against the `i'` R-partner (reuse
`iRcritG`/`iRKc` machinery, now indexed at `(i', majorIdx)` — the redex pair is `(i', majorIdx)` with
`tp (znth ds i') = isymR (^∀p / inegF p)` and `dⱼ` the L-axiom; check `iRKc`/`iRcritG` already take the
redex indices via `redexI`/`redexJ` and whether `majorIdx` ⟹ those match); (3) the atomic `iRK` swap
(`permIdx ↦ majorIdx` in def + `red_zK_rep`/`_rep_nonchain`/`_splice` + `iord_descent_red` case split on
`majorPrem_tag_mem`: tag 3 → `iRedDescent_zInd`, tag 4 → chain recursion, tags 5/6 → critical via the
cut-partner). Then `iord_descent_red` has NO fixpoint branch ⟹ `iord_red_iterate_descends` is a strict
descent ⟹ feed PRWO(ε₀) in `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty`.

## lap 129 — FRESH-MIND REVIEW: the `red`-STALL is the crux; no-stall linchpin landed
**Build 🟢 1326.** Landed (axiom-clean, additive): **`firstBotPrem_reducible`** (`InternalZ.lean`) — the
faithful major premise of a `∅→⊥` chain (first `⊥`-exit) has `zTag ∉ {0,7}`, i.e. `red`-reducible.

**FINDING (resolves lap-120 item-1, vacuity — NO):** the `red`-STALL (atom/`zAx1`-selected `∅→⊥` K-node =
`red`-fixpoint) is GENUINE. Refuted in-kernel: `zReg (zAtom s)=0`, `zReg (zAx1 s C)=0`; `zAtom`/`zAx1`
`ZPhi` disjuncts carry only `inAnt (seqSucc s)(seqAnt s)` (no atomicity). So `ZRegular`/`ZFresh` do NOT kill
the stall; a leaf-stall ⊥-orbit `ZDerivation` exists. The fix is Buchholz §14.25's MAJOR-PREMISE selection
(first premise with succedent = D), not the first `iperm`-permissible. The lap-121/122 redex-finder line
(`inference_critical_pair_of_chain_reroute`) is a DEAD END on the ⊥-orbit (needs a non-`isymRep` exit; ⊥-exits
are `zK`/`zInd` `isymRep`; its `hreroute`-for-non-leaf residual is false).

**ATTACK PATH — the faithful-selection engine re-key (next lap's HIGHEST VALUE):**
1. ✅ **DONE — `majorIdx d`** (`InternalZ.lean`, mirror `permIdxAux`): least `i < lh (zKseq d)` with
   `chainAsucc (zKseq d) i = seqSucc (fstIdx d)` (`isMajorPrem`). Full `𝚺₁`-definable PR.Blueprint +
   `_le`/`_isMajorPrem_of_lt`/`_eq_self_of_none`/`_found`/`_le_of_isMajorPrem`. On the ⊥-orbit = first `⊥`-exit.
2. ✅ **DONE (selector form) — `majorIdx_botOrbit_reducible`:** on a `∅→⊥` chain, `majorIdx` lands IN-RANGE on
   a `⊥`-succedent premise with `zTag ∉ {0,7}` — the end-to-end no-stall guarantee. (The `red d ≠ d`
   consequence falls out once `iRK` uses `majorIdx`: the selected premise is non-leaf hence `red`-reducible.)
3. **Re-key `iRK`** replace branch: dispatch on `majorIdx` (was `permIdx`). Critical/splice fires when the
   major premise's OWN reduction is an `(R,L)` cut (Buchholz 14.253). Ripples: `permIdx`/`permIdxAux`-family
   `𝚺₁` defs, `iord_descent_red` (atom/`zAx1` fixpoint branches → UNREACHABLE, drop), `fstIdx_red_*` /
   `tp_selected_isymRep_of_emptyAnt_botSucc` (re-anchor on `majorIdx`).
4. **`false_of_ZDerivesEmpty`:** no ⊥-orbit fixpoints ⟹ `iord_red_iterate_descends` strict ⟹ PRWO(ε₀)
   contradiction. Remaining endgame: the PRWO `𝚺₁`-graph wiring (`n ↦ iord (red^[n] z)` vs well-foundedness).

**CONTAINED ALTERNATIVE (if re-key too invasive):** keep `permIdx`, prove `no_red_fixpoint_of_ZDerivesEmptyR`
directly — bridge `permIdx`-selects-leaf ⟹ that leaf is NOT the `firstBotPrem` major premise ⟹ the node has a
genuinely-reducible exit elsewhere ⟹ contradiction with `red d = d`. Murkier soundness; the re-key is faithful.

## lap 128 (late) — SOUNDNESS FRONT CONSOLIDATED + the plumbing's true shape FOUND
**Build 🟢 1326.** Landed (all sorry-free, axiom-clean): `ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_all` (∀, freshness from
orbit) · `ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_neg` (¬) · **`ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_of_zKValid`** (both polarities from chain
validity — = `ZDerivation_red_zK_crit` minus the engine swap). Its residual = the plumbing bundle
`hCwff`/`hSeqs`/`hthread`/`hrank`/`hAll`/`hNeg`.

**⭐ FINDING (source-read this lap, sharpens the next attack):** the per-node bundle facts are NOT cheap
inversions — they are `isChainInf`-consistency facts, the SAME source as threading/rank. Concretely:
- The axAll node's ZPhi disjunct is `∃ s p k, d = zAxAll s p k ∧ IsUFormula p ∧ inAnt (^∀p) (seqAnt s)` —
  it does **NOT** pin `seqSucc s = F(k)`. So `hsj : seqSucc sⱼ = cutFormula` (∀ bundle) is a genuine
  chain-consistency fact: the L-redex's stored succedent matches the cut instance `cutFormula =
  substs1 (numeral (π₁π₂(tp dⱼ))) p` (`cutFormula` def `InternalZ:6578`, read off `chainAsucc (redexI)` +
  `tp (redexJ)`). It must come from `isChainInf`'s threading at `redexJ` (the L-redex succedent threads as
  a chain-Asucc), NOT from the axAll node alone.
- Likewise `hd0ant` (¬), `Seq (seqAnt sⱼ/sᵢ)`, `hCwff` route through chain validity / premise inversion.

**⟹ next-lap unit (extract EVERYTHING from `isChainInf` at once):** obtain `⟨j0, hj0, hAj0, hchain, hrank⟩`
from `zKValid`'s `isChainInf`, establish the SINGLE structural bound **`redexJ ≤ j0`** (THE open question;
likely free if these chains carry the last-premise tip `j0 = lh ds − 1`, cf. `isChainInf_of_last`
`InternalZ:1208` — check the M2 embedding + reduct constructions for how `isChainInf` is built), then
`thread_rank_restrict_of_le` (`InternalZ:5112`) gives `hthread`/`hrank` ≤/< `redexJ` directly, and the
per-node `hsj`/`hd0ant` consistency facts fall out of the same `hchain`/`hAj0` threading data. `hAll`'s
`maxEigen d0 < a` = `maxEigen_lt_of_regular_zIall` (`Zsubst:1434`) from the orbit `ZRegular`; `IsUFormula p`
from `zKValid`'s tag-1 wff (`hf1`). Feed all into `ZDerivation_iRKcCrit_of_zKValid` ⟹ `ZDerivation_red_zK_crit`
(post-swap).

## lap 128 — `ZFresh_red` PROVEN COMPLETE (red-stability of the freshness invariant)
**Build 🟢 1326; `ZFresh_red` + the full `zK`-dispatch family axiom-clean `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]` (Zsubst).**

`theorem ZFresh_red : ∀ d, ZDerivation d → ZFresh d → ZFresh (red d)` — closed (lap 127 had only the
structural + Ind cases). The `zK` chain dispatch (`ZFresh_red_zK` + `_replace`/`_crit`/`_splice`/
`_splice_of_chain` + structural blocks `ZFresh_zK_of_seqUpdate`/`_iCritReductSeq`/`_seqInsert`,
`ZFresh_zAxReduct`, `ZFresh_iRcritG_premise`) mirrors `ZRegular_red_zK` line-for-line. Key simplification:
`zFresh(zK)` is the pure premise max-fold (`zFresh_zK`), so every branch reduces to "every reduct premise is
`ZFresh`", closed by `zfresh_zK_of`.

**✅ target 2 DONE: `∧ ZFresh d` threaded into `ZDerivesEmptyR`** (`Crux2Blueprint:933`). 3rd conjunct added;
`ZDerivesEmptyR_red` discharges it via `ZFresh_red d h.1.1 h.2.2`; `redSound` / `iord_descent_red`
re-indexed `.2 → .2.1`. The freshness invariant is now carried across the whole `red`-orbit.

**✅ target-3 SUPPLIERS DONE (`Zsubst.lean`, after `fvSubstSeq_numeral_eq_self_of_zfresh_zIall`):** the two
bridge lemmas that feed `ZDerivation_iRcritG_critReductCorr`'s freshness hyps at any L-redex instance `k`:
`fvSubst_numeral_eq_self_of_zfresh_zIall_at` (matrix; takes `IsUFormula p` from the I∀ node's ZDerivation
wff) + `fvSubstSeq_numeral_eq_self_of_zfresh_zIall_at` (antecedent; NO external hyp — `seqWffFlag` gives the
entrywise wff free). Axiom-clean `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`.

**NEXT — the engine re-key (the genuine remaining crux, lap-114/119 finding).** `ZDerivation_red_zK_crit`
(`Crux2Blueprint:517`, sorry) is FALSE for the current `ρ = zAxReduct ∘ red` (R-redex derives instance-0,
not the L-redex instance `k` — `cutFormula` mismatch). The fix is the ATOMIC engine swap: re-key `red`'s
tag-4 critical branch (`iRNextG`/`red_zK_crit`) to emit `critReductCorr (zK s r ds)` (re-principalizes at
`k`), then `ZDerivation_red_zK_crit`'s body becomes `ZDerivation_iRcritG_critReductCorr` (PROVEN), with
`hpfresh`/`hΓfresh` now discharged by the two suppliers above (chain: `zfresh_zK_premise` on the orbit
`ZFresh (zK)` → `ZFresh dᵢ`, rewrite `dᵢ = zIall sᵢ a p d0` via `hdi`, apply supplier at
`k = π₁(π₂(tp dⱼ))`). Lap-119 scoped this as 3 fronts (O1 regularity = LANDED; descent re-key; soundness
assembly); the freshness front (O3) is now fully de-risked. See `HANDOFF-2026-06-26-lap128.md`,
`engine-swap-not-pure-wiring-lap119` memory.

**✅ BOTH invariant fronts of the swap's critical reduct now LANDED additively:** `ZRegular_iRKcCrit` (O1,
lap 119) + **`ZFresh_iRKcCrit` (O3, this lap)** — `iRKcCrit d` (the explicit re-keyed reduct) preserves both
`ZRegular` and `ZFresh`. So once `red`'s tag-4 branch emits `iRKcCrit`, the `ZRegular_red_zK_crit` /
`ZFresh_red_zK_crit` re-proofs are one-liners (`ZRegular_iRKcCrit` / `ZFresh_iRKcCrit` fed the chain's own
premise invariants via `ZRegular_zK_premise` / `ZFresh_zK_premise` + `redexI`-tag from the orbit). The
genuine remaining work in the swap is (a) re-key `iRK`'s `else` branch `iRKc d s ↦ iRKcCrit d` +
`iRKDef`/`iRNextGDef` arithmetization (the `iRKcCritDef` `𝚺₁` graph is already built), (b) the DESCENT
re-key (`iord_descent_red` ↦ `iord_iRcritG_eq_iRcrit` family, RedZKDescent), (c) re-point `red_zK_crit` +
the `ZDerivation_red_zK_crit` body to `ZDerivation_iRcritG_critReductCorr` (PROVEN, freshness now supplied).

**✅ FRESHNESS FRONT FULLY PACKAGED (this lap):** `zfresh_critReductCorr_freshness` (`Zsubst.lean`, after
`ZFresh_iRKcCrit`) delivers the exact `⟨hpfresh, hΓfresh⟩` pair `ZDerivation_iRcritG_critReductCorr` needs
at the L-instance `k = π₁(π₂(tp dⱼ))`, from just `ZFresh (zK s r ds)` (orbit) + the R-redex form `hdi` +
matrix wff. So step (c)'s only remaining inputs are the NON-freshness orbit data (threading `hthread`, rank
`hrank`/`hrankI`, `hSeqs`/`hSeqsj`, `hsj`, `hCwff`) — all derivable from the chain's `isChainInf` validity
(`redZKReady_of_zKValid` gives `hdi`/`hdj`/`hIJ`/`hj` + rank relation; threading/rank from the parent
`isChainInf` restricted to `≤ redex`, cf. `thread_rank_restrict_of_le`). The freshness obstruction (the
lap-114 "instance-0 vs instance-k" finding) is now CLOSED on the supply side; what remains is pure
chain-validity plumbing + the atomic `red`/`iRK` redefinition.

## lap 127 — `zFresh_zsubst` SUBSTRATE landed (commutation + node-level preservation); the gap is now ONE wff invariant
**Build 🟢 1326; 5 new lemmas axiom-clean `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]` (Zsubst).**

**✅ LANDED — downward freshness-preservation substrate (after `fvSubstSeq_numeral_transfer`).** Lap 126's
plan called `zFresh_zsubst` an *equality* (mirror `zReg_zsubst`). **That is wrong** — corrected this lap:
substituting *away* an eigenvariable can only make a node MORE fresh, so at an I∀ node whose eigenvariable
*is* the substituted `a`, `zFresh` can DROP. The right statement is the **directional**
`ZFresh d → ZFresh (zsubst d a (numeral n))`. Its engine:
- `termFvSubst_numeral_comm` / `termFvSubstVec_numeral_comm` / `fvSubst_numeral_comm` (`e ≠ a`): two
  distinct fresh-variable *numeral* substitutions COMMUTE (numerals are closed). Pure `IsUTerm`/`IsUFormula`
  induction.
- `fvSubst_numeral_fresh_subst` (formula) / `fvSubstSeq_numeral_fresh_subst` (sequence): `fvSubst e
  (numeral 0) · = ·` (non-occurrence of `^&e`) SURVIVES `fvSubst a (numeral n)`. The `e = a` case is
  `fvSubst_numeral_idem` (collapse, no hypothesis); `e ≠ a` is commutation + the hypothesis.
- **`freshFlag_zsubst_eq_zero`** (after `freshFlag_snd`, in the zFresh section) + `freshFlag_eq_zero`
  constructor: the per-I∀-node step — `freshFlag e p Γ = 0` ⟹ `freshFlag e (fvSubst a (numeral n) p)
  (fvSubstSeq a (numeral n) Γ) = 0`, given **`IsUFormula p`** and **`∀ i, IsUFormula (znth Γ i)`**.

**⭐ THE REMAINING GAP, now isolated to ONE thing — antecedent well-formedness.** `freshFlag_zsubst_eq_zero`
needs the I∀ node's antecedent entries (`seqAnt s`) to be `UFormula`s. **`ZDerivation` does NOT supply this**:
the `zAtom`/`zAx1` ZPhi disjuncts carry only `inAnt (seqSucc s) (seqAnt s)` — a single membership, NOT
entrywise `IsUFormula`. So `zFresh_zsubst` (directional) is genuinely **FALSE for pathological derivations**
with garbage I∀ antecedents (a non-`UFormula` antecedent entry breaks the structural `fvSubst` commutation),
and MUST be conditioned on a well-formedness companion. The matrix half is free (`zIallWff` gives
`IsSemiformula 1 p` ⟹ `IsUFormula p`, via `tag_uformula_of_ZDerivation`/`hwff.2.2.isUFormula`); only the
ANTECEDENT half needs the invariant.

**✅ UPDATE (same lap 127) — `zFresh_zsubst` (directional) is now PROVEN; targets 1 & the wff gap are CLOSED.**
The antecedent-wff gap was resolved by **folding `seqWffFlag`** (a `𝚺₁` all-entries-`IsUFormula` indicator)
**into `freshFlag`** — so `zFresh` now carries the antecedent well-formedness itself (the embedding supplies
it; `red`/`zsubst` preserve it via `IsUFormula.fvSubst`). `freshFlag = max(matrix-fresh, antecedent-fresh,
seqWffFlag)`; extractors `freshFlag_fst`/`_snd`/`_wff` + 3-arg `freshFlag_eq_zero` + `seqWffFlag_fvSubstSeq`.
Then `zFresh_zsubst : ZFresh d → ZFresh (zsubst d a (numeral n))` by `zDerivation_induction` (I∀ =
`freshFlag_zsubst_eq_zero`; chain = `zfresh_zK_of`/`zfresh_zK_premise` — new `zFresh_zK` fold +
`iseqMaxAux_eq_zero_of`). All axiom-clean, green 1326. **The matrix `IsUFormula p` is free from `zIallWff`.**

**REMAINING NEXT-LAP TARGETS (in order):**
1. **`ZFresh_red`** (red-stability, mirror the `zReg`→`ZRegular_red` chain `Zsubst.lean:1704`
   `ZRegular_red_of_not_zK` + the zK splice/replace lemmas). Use `zFresh_zsubst` at the `red_zIall`/I¬
   sites; the chain `red` cases fold via `zfresh_zK_premise`/`zfresh_zK_of`. NB `ZFresh` is DOWNWARD-closed
   (an implication), so `ZFresh_red` should read `ZFresh d → ZFresh (red d)` (not an equality like
   `zReg`'s) — the `red` zK-critical reduct replaces premises by `zsubst`/`zInegPrem`/`zAx1` children, each
   `ZFresh` by `zFresh_zsubst` / premise-extraction / `zFresh_zAx1 = 0`.
2. **Thread `∧ ZFresh d` into `ZDerivesEmptyR`** (Crux2Blueprint:933); the embedding
   `foundation_bot_to_Z_empty` supplies it (real formula antecedents ⟹ `seqWffFlag = 0`; eigenvariables
   chosen fresh ⟹ the two fresh-eqs). Then LEFT-branch ∀-soundness closes via
   `ZDerivation_iRcritG_critReductCorr` (`hpfresh = fvSubst_numeral_transfer (matrix UFormula)
   (fvSubst_numeral_eq_self_of_zfresh_zIall (zfresh_zK_premise …))`, `hΓfresh` likewise).
3. ¬-case (`iRcritGNeg`, lap-117) — same substrate covers it.

**(SUPERSEDED) original target 1 — antecedent-wff gap resolution (kept for context):**
1. **Resolve the antecedent-wff gap.** Cheapest principled option: a `𝚫₁` companion invariant
   `zAntWff`-style "every node's antecedent entries are `UFormula`" (mirror the `zReg`/`zFresh` table; the
   atom/zAx1 leaves get the constraint as a NEW ZPhi side condition — but that ripples ZPhi, which lap-126
   warned against). **Better:** bundle `∀ i < lh (seqAnt (fstIdx d')), IsUFormula …` for the relevant nodes
   into the carried `ZDerivesEmptyR` invariant (the embedding `foundation_bot_to_Z_empty` builds real
   sequents ⟹ supplies it), and thread it alongside `ZFresh`. Decide which after checking how the consumer
   `ZDerivation_iRcritG_critReductCorr` already obtains `seqAnt sᵢ`-entry-`UFormula` (the chain `zKValidF`
   carries `∀ k < lh (seqAnt s), IsUFormula (znth (seqAnt s) k)` for the K node — see if the I∀ child's
   antecedent inherits it via threading).
2. **Assemble `zFresh_zsubst`** (directional) by `zDerivation_induction (P := fun d => ZFresh d ∧ <antWff d>
   → ZFresh (zsubst d a (numeral n)))` — I∀ via `freshFlag_zsubst_eq_zero` + IH; tags 2/3/4 fold via the
   `zFresh_z*` recursion eqns + IH; leaves are `zFresh = 0` already. → `ZFresh_red`.
3. Thread `∧ ZFresh d` (+ the antWff companion) into `ZDerivesEmptyR`; close LEFT-branch ∀-soundness via
   `ZDerivation_iRcritG_critReductCorr` (`hpfresh = fvSubst_numeral_transfer … (fvSubst_numeral_eq_self_of_zfresh_zIall …)`).

## lap 126 — FRESH-MIND REVIEW: freshness substrate LANDED; mechanism COURSE-CORRECTED (no ZPhi ripple)
**Build 🟢 (Zsubst + crux-2 stack rebuilt); 4 new transfer lemmas axiom-clean `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`.**

**⭐ The lap-125 plan's MECHANISM is wrong — corrected.** Lap 125 pinned the LEFT-branch ∀-soundness
residual to the eigenvariable condition (`hpfresh`/`hΓfresh`) and proposed *strengthening the `ZPhi` I∀
disjunct* (a 64-site atomic ripple). **That contradicts the repo's own lap-93 additive-O1 architecture**
(`Zsubst.lean:947`, verbatim): "rather than baking freshness into `zIallWff` (which would shrink the
`ZDerivation` fixpoint and force the embedding to re-prove it), `zReg` is a standalone `𝚺₁` function
threaded *alongside* `ZDerivation`." Baking freshness into `zIallWff`/`ZPhi` would ALSO break the proven
load-bearing `ZDerivation_zsubst` (a code-bound `p ≤ a` is NOT `zsubst`-stable — lap-92; and even the
semantic form forces re-proving the fixpoint's `𝚫₁` definability + every `rcases` site). **The principled
fix = a standalone `zFresh` invariant** (exact parallel of `zReg`), threaded into `ZDerivesEmptyR`.

**Why the SEMANTIC non-occurrence form (not the code bound).** `a ∉ FV(p)` ⟺ `fvSubst a (numeral 0) p = p`
is `𝚫₁` (storable) AND `red`/`zsubst`-stable: substituting a *different* var `a''` by a *closed* numeral
introduces no new `^&a`, so non-occurrence is preserved (the code bound `p ≤ a` is not — lap-92). This is
why `zFresh` must store the substitution-identity, not an ordering.

**✅ LANDED this lap — the transfer substrate (`Zsubst.lean`, after `isSemiterm_succVar`).** The storable
witness is at `numeral 0` but the consumer needs it at the *cut instance* `numeral k'` (unknown at the I∀
node). Bridged by the **double-substitution-collapses** identity (a numeral has no `^&a`):
- `termFvSubst_numeral_idem`, `termFvSubstVec_numeral_idem`, `fvSubst_numeral_idem` — `fvSubst a s (fvSubst
  a (numeral m) ·) = fvSubst a (numeral m) ·` (collapse).
- **`fvSubst_numeral_transfer`** : `IsUFormula p → fvSubst a (numeral m) p = p → fvSubst a (numeral k) p = p`.
- **`fvSubstSeq_numeral_idem` / `fvSubstSeq_numeral_transfer`** : the `seqAnt`-sequence analogues (entries
  `IsUFormula`).
These plug DIRECTLY into `ZDerivation_iRcritG_critReductCorr` (Crux2Blueprint:470): `hpfresh` =
`fvSubst_numeral_transfer hp h0`, `hΓfresh` = `fvSubstSeq_numeral_transfer hΓ h0Γ`, where `k` = the
consumer's `π₁(π₂(tp(znth ds redexJ)))` and `h0`/`h0Γ` are the `numeral 0` witnesses from `zFresh`.

**✅ ALSO LANDED this lap — the standalone `zFresh` invariant (`Zsubst.lean`, after `zReg_zsubst`).**
Full mirror of the `zReg` table machinery, all axiom-clean `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`:
`eqFlag` (`𝚺₀` equality flag) → `freshFlag a p Γ = max (eqFlag (fvSubst a (numeral 0) p) p) (eqFlag
(fvSubstSeq a (numeral 0) Γ) Γ)` (`𝚺₁`, via `numeralGraph`/`fvSubstGraph`/`fvSubstSeqDef`) → `zFreshNext`
(flag at tag 1 I∀ only; tags 2/3/4 fold premises) → `zFreshTable`/`zFresh` (`PR.Construction`) → recursion
eqns (`zFresh_zIall`/`zIneg`/`zInd`/`zAtom`/`zAxAll`/`zAxNeg`/`zAx1`) → **`ZFresh d := zFresh d = 0`** +
per-node extraction **`fvSubst_numeral_eq_self_of_zfresh_zIall`** / **`fvSubstSeq_numeral_eq_self_of_zfresh_zIall`**
(the `maxEigen_lt_of_regular_zIall` analogues) + **`zfresh_zIallPrem`** (premise stays fresh). These compose
with the transfer lemmas to give `hpfresh`/`hΓfresh` at the cut instance `k`. **The freshness front is now
DEFINED + per-node-extractable end-to-end.**

**NEXT-LAP TARGETS (in order) — REPLACES lap-125's ZPhi-ripple plan:**
1. **`zFresh_zsubst` stability** (mirror `zReg_zsubst`, Zsubst:1329 — `zDerivation_induction`, 8 cases):
   `zFresh (zsubst d a t) = zFresh d` for `ZDerivation d`, closed `t`. The I∀ case needs: the per-node flag
   is preserved, i.e. `freshFlag a' (fvSubst a t p) (fvSubstSeq a t Γ) = freshFlag a' p Γ` when `a' ≠ a` —
   non-occurrence of `a'` survives substituting a *different* var by a *closed* term. Needs a small
   commutation lemma `fvSubst a' (numeral 0) (fvSubst a t p) = fvSubst a t (fvSubst a' (numeral 0) p)`
   (distinct fresh vars commute) — pure `FvSubst` induction. → `red`-stability (`ZFresh_red`, mirror the
   `zReg`→`ZRegular_red` chain).
2. Add `∧ ZFresh d` to `ZDerivesEmptyR` (Crux2Blueprint:933); the embedding `foundation_bot_to_Z_empty`
   supplies it (choose eigenvariables fresh). Then the LEFT-branch ∀-soundness closes via
   `ZDerivation_iRcritG_critReductCorr` (feed `hpfresh = fvSubst_numeral_transfer (…) (fvSubst_numeral_eq_self_of_zfresh_zIall …)`);
   assemble the LEFT successor + restructure `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` off the `red`-orbit onto the dichotomy
   successor + WF(`iord`) (lap-124 plan unchanged below).
3. ¬-case (`iRcritGNeg`, lap-117) needs the same freshness; the transfer + extraction substrate already covers it.

## lap 124 — the stall-bypassing DESCENT is built; the `red`-fixpoint defect is now ROUTED AROUND
**Build 🟢 1326; both new theorems axiom-clean `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`** (RedZKDescent, after
`iord_descent_red_zK_crit`).
- ✅ **`iord_descent_iRcrit_botChain_leaves`** — the genuine fix for the `red`-fixpoint defect. The
  critical-cut reduct `iRcrit (zK s r ds) (zAxReduct∘red)` of a ⊥-chain `ZDerivation` strictly
  `iord`-descends **regardless of `red`'s `permIdx` selection**, provided every `isymRep` premise is a leaf
  (`hleaves`). Manufactures the redex via `inference_critical_pair_of_botChain` (leaf-tolerant reroute
  finder) and feeds `iord_descent_iRcrit_of_redex` DIRECTLY — never touches `red (zK s r ds)`, so the
  documented stall (`red d = d`) is IRRELEVANT to this descent. The 6 ρ-facts reuse the banked
  `iRedDescent_zAxReduct_red_of_tp_isymR`/`_isymLk` bundles (same as the fully-critical case).
- ✅ **`iRcrit_descends_or_nonleaf_isymRep`** — the descent DICHOTOMY: for a regular ⊥-chain `ZDerivation`,
  EITHER `iRcrit` `iord`-descends (case 5.1, stall-tolerant) OR a non-leaf `isymRep` premise exists (case
  5.2 splice). This is the case split the restructured endgame consumes — a genuine `iord`-decreasing
  successor on the LEFT with NO `red`/`permIdx` dependence (no fixpoint branch).

**THE ENDGAME RESTRUCTURE (the remaining frontier, sharpened).** `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` should NO LONGER
iterate `red` (whose fixpoint branch is unprovable — lap-123 finding). Instead, build the infinite
`iord`-descent from the dichotomy: from a ⊥-derivation `z` (tag 3 Ind / tag 4 K), produce a strictly
`iord`-smaller ⊥-derivation successor, then `PRWO(ε₀)` / well-foundedness forbids the infinite descent.
Remaining inputs:
1. **LEFT successor is a valid ⊥-derivation** — `iRcritG (zK s r ds) (zAxReduct∘red)` must be a
   `ZDerivesEmptyR` (ZDerivation of ∅→⊥ + regular) so the descent can RECURSE. This is reduct SOUNDNESS:
   `ZDerivation_red_zK_crit` (the haux0/haux1 inversion, mostly banked — Crux2Blueprint sorry) +
   `fstIdx`/`ZRegular` preservation. `iord_descent_iRcrit_botChain_leaves` already gives the ordinal drop;
   only the *validity* of the successor remains.
2. **RIGHT successor (non-leaf isymRep)** — the case-5.2 splice into the permissible chain/Ind premise
   (smaller ordinal). Existing `ZDerivation_red_zK_splice` / `iord_descent_red` chain-REPLACE machinery.
3. **`hleaves` in the LEFT branch is now provided by the dichotomy's own case split** — no longer an open
   hypothesis; the non-leaf case is the RIGHT branch.
4. Ind (tag 3) top node: `red d = iRInd d` already descends (`iord_descent_red_zInd`, banked) and stays a
   ⊥-derivation (`ZDerivesEmptyR_red` for tag 3 — no stall).

**⭐ lap 125 — the LEFT-branch SOUNDNESS residual pinned to a single, precise encoding gap.**
The sound LEFT successor is NOT `iRcritG (zK s r ds) (zAxReduct∘red)` — lap-114 proved that FALSE (`red`'s
I∀ reduct is instance-0, not the cut instance `k`). The SOUND object is `iRcritG (zK s r ds)
(critReductCorr (zK s r ds))` (the re-principalized reduct), and BOTH its soundness and its descent are
ALREADY banked:
- **soundness**: `ZDerivation_iRcritG_critReductCorr` (Crux2Blueprint:470) — `ZDerivation (iRcritG d
  (critReductCorr d))` for the ∀-redex case, modulo orbit data;
- **descent**: `iord_descent_iRcritG_critReductCorr` (RedZKDescent:457) — but it needs FULL `zKValid`
  (criticality), so it does NOT cover the stall; my `iord_descent_iRcrit_botChain_leaves` (lap 124) is the
  stall-tolerant descent, and `iord` is instance-invariant so the two `iord` values agree.

**THE ONE GENUINE OPEN INPUT — O3 freshness = the eigenvariable condition, MISSING from `ZPhi`.**
`ZDerivation_iRcritG_critReductCorr`'s residual orbit data is `hfresh_eig` (✅ suppliable —
`maxEigen_lt_of_regular_zIall`, Zsubst:1206, from `ZRegular`), threading/rank (✅ from `isChainInf`/`zKValidF`,
since `redexI ≤ j0`), and **`hpfresh : fvSubst a (numeral k) p = p` + `hΓfresh : fvSubstSeq a (numeral k)
(seqAnt sᵢ) = seqAnt sᵢ`** — i.e. the eigenvariable `a` does NOT occur free in the matrix `p` or the
antecedent `seqAnt sᵢ`. This is exactly the I∀ EIGENVARIABLE CONDITION (`a ∉ FV(Γ → ∀xF)`). **The current
`ZPhi` I∀ disjunct does NOT track it** (`⟨s,a,p,d0,rfl,hd0,hsucc,hwff⟩` — premise + succ + wff only, NO
freshness; and `zReg`/`ZRegular` only tracks `maxEigen d0 < a`, not `a ∉ FV(p)`). So `hpfresh`/`hΓfresh` are
genuinely un-suppliable from the present encoding.

**NEXT-LAP TARGETS (in order):**
1. **[lap 125+] Strengthen the `ZPhi` I∀ disjunct with the eigenvariable freshness** (`fvSubst a · p = p`
   ∧ `fvSubstSeq a · (seqAnt s) = seqAnt s`), then ripple through `ZPhi`/`zphi_monotone`/`_strong_finite`/
   `zphi_iff`/`zblueprint` σ+π/`zPhi_definable` + the `zDerivation_zIall_inv` accessor — the SAME pattern as
   the lap-115 `zAx1` 8th-disjunct and lap-118 `zAxNeg` strengthenings. This supplies `hpfresh`/`hΓfresh` to
   `ZDerivation_iRcritG_critReductCorr`, closing LEFT-branch soundness for the ∀-case. (¬-case via
   `_haux1_neg`, already half-built.)
2. Assemble the LEFT successor as a `ZDerivesEmptyR` (soundness + `fstIdx`/`ZRegular` preservation) ⟹ a
   self-contained recursive descent step; restructure `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` off the `red`-orbit onto the
   dichotomy successor + WF(`iord`).
3. RIGHT splice branch validity (case 5.2). Then `foundation_bot_to_Z_empty` (M2) + `gentzenDescentφ`.

## lap 122 — the generalized redex finder is ASSEMBLED; the "L-axiom caveat" is REFUTED
**Build 🟢 1326; new theorem axiom-clean `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`.** Banked
`inference_critical_pair_of_chain_reroute` (InternalZ, right after `exit_nonRep_of_reroute`).

**THE DELIVERABLE.** The full Sub-lemma A + Sub-lemma B assembly the lap-121 baton scheduled. It is
`inference_critical_pair_of_chain` with its `hnperm` **isymRep clause replaced by a re-route hypothesis**
`hreroute : ∀ i ≤ j0, tp(znth ds i) = isymRep → ∃ i' < i, chainAsucc ds i' = chainAsucc ds i`. It still
produces the genuine `(R_A, L^k_A)` redex with `0 < rk A ≤ r`. So a valid ⊥-chain whose ONLY
criticality-failures are re-routable permissible premises STILL drives the K-descent
(`iord_descent_iRcrit_of_redex`) — the threaded-atom stall dissolved with no engine surgery, **modulo
discharging `hreroute`**. Proof structure: Step A = `exit_nonRep_of_reroute` (non-Rep exit ⟹ left symbol);
Step B = least left symbol `j` (search over `tpSeq ds`, NOT `tp(znth ds ·)` — the latter blows up aesop
depth, see below); Step C = least source `i'` of the cut formula `B` via `least_number` on the definable
`chainAsucc ds · = B`.

**⭐ THE L-AXIOM CAVEAT IS REFUTED (the decisive lap-121 sub-question, settled).** The lap-121 baton flagged
as a genuine risk: "the threading may bottom out at an `isymLk` L-axiom (succ B), not an `isymR(B)`
producer — then the generalized finder FAILS." It does NOT. Step B takes the **LEAST** left-symbol index
`j`; the cut formula `B = A_i` (i < j) is re-routed to its **least** source `i'`, and `i' ≤ i < j`, so
every re-route lands strictly below `j` — where by minimality of `j` there are **no left symbols at all**.
Hence the source can never be an `isymLk` L-axiom. The least source `i'` is non-left (minimality of `j`) and
non-`isymRep` (a re-route would hand back a strictly smaller source, contradicting `i'` least), therefore
`I_{i'} = R_B`. The redex is `(i', j)`. So path (i) is sound on the L-axiom front; the baton's pessimism
was over-cautious.

**THE GENUINE RESIDUAL (sharpened, replaces the refuted caveat) — discharge `hreroute`.** The finder is
banked modulo its one open input `hreroute`, which must hold for **every** `isymRep` premise `≤ j0`.
`chainAsucc_threaded_of_leaf` (lap 121) discharges it for the LEAF isymRep shapes (`zAtom`/`zAx1`, tags
0/7) — their succedent sits in their own antecedent, so chain-threading routes it to an earlier premise.
But `isymRep` ALSO arises from **chain (tag-3) and Ind (tag-4)** premises (`tp_zK`/`tp_zInd`), whose
succedent need NOT appear in their own antecedent — so the leaf lemma does not re-route them. **Decisive
next sub-question:** in a valid ⊥-chain, can a chain/Ind premise (isymRep, succedent = the cut formula `B`,
`0 < rk B`) appear at the least source `i'` (i.e. below the least left symbol)? Two ways to close:
- **(α) exclude / defer them:** likely the right framing — a chain/Ind premise with succ `B` (`0 < rk B`) is
  itself a smaller derivation of `B`, so the *outer* descent recursion (`iord`) covers it; the finder need
  only handle the genuinely-atomic stall. Show the least source ≤ j0 is never tag-3/4, or split the
  descent so tag-3/4 sources route to the IH.
- **(β) re-route them too** — probably FALSE in general (a chain's succedent is free), so (α) is likelier.

**Definability recipe worth remembering (lap 122).** `simp only [isymIsL]; definability` on
`isymIsL (tp (znth ds x))` TIMES OUT at whnf (aesop depth-blowup on the composed `tp`, per memory
`definability-aesop-depth-blowup`). Two fixes were both needed: (i) search over the coded map `tpSeq ds`
via `znth (tpSeq ds) x` (`znth_tpSeq` bridges `= tp (znth ds x)` for `x < lh ds`) instead of `tp(znth ds ·)`;
(ii) `set Is := tpSeq ds with hIs; clear_value Is` BEFORE `definability`, else `definability` recurses into
`tpSeq`'s heavy `PR.Construction` and times out. The whole theorem also needs `set_option maxHeartbeats
1000000`. The `chainAsucc ds · = B` predicate uses the hand-built comp term from `exit_nonRep_of_reroute`.

**⭐ ARCHITECTURE CLARIFICATION (lap 122, late) — the chain/Ind residual is NOT a finder gap; it is the
non-critical case 5.2.** A chain (tag-3) / Ind (tag-4) `isymRep` premise makes the ⊥-chain NON-critical
(Buchholz Def 3.2 case 5: a permissible premise exists). Buchholz handles non-critical chains by case 5.2
(the SPLICE / Rep reduction into the permissible premise — smaller ordinal), NOT by the Lemma-3.1 redex
finder (case 5.1). So the reroute finder is supposed to handle ONLY the leaf-stall (case 5.1 with
re-routable atom/`zAx1` permissible premises); the chain/Ind case routes to the EXISTING splice machinery
(`ZDerivation_red_zK_splice` / `iord_descent_red` chain-REPLACE — already sorries). The lap-121/122
"residual `hleaves`" is therefore the CRITICALITY-MODULO-LEAVES side of the case-5.1/5.2 dichotomy, not a
hole to plug inside the finder.

**CONSOLIDATION BANKED (lap 122, 5th commit): `inference_critical_pair_of_botChain`** (InternalZ, after
`iord_descent_iRcrit_of_chain_reroute`). A `ZDerivation (zK s r ds)` with `seqAnt s = ∅`, `seqSucc s = ⊥`
contains the genuine `(R_A, L^k_A)` redex (with `0 < rk A ≤ r`) **provided every `isymRep` premise is a leaf
(`hleaves`)**. ALL finder bookkeeping discharged internally from `ZDerivation` (`zKValidF` ⟹
isChainInf/hperm/hwfR/hwfL; `hreroute` via `hreroute_of_leaves`). **New free fact:** for a ⊥-chain `hnperm2`
is automatic — `tp = R_⊥` is impossible (`tp_isymR_pos` ⟹ `0 < rk ⊥ = 0`) and the L-at-`Γmain` clause is
vacuous on the empty antecedent. So the leaf-stall redex existence now reduces to JUST `hleaves`.

**lap 123 — DICHOTOMY BANKED + the `red`-fixpoint defect pinned precisely.**
- ✅ **`redex_or_nonleaf_isymRep_of_botChain`** (InternalZ, after `inference_critical_pair_of_botChain`):
  for a `ZDerivation` ⊥-chain, EITHER a genuine `(R_A,L^k_A)` redex exists (case 5.1) OR a non-leaf
  `isymRep` premise (chain/Ind, case 5.2) exists. Proved by EM + the botChain finder. Axiom-clean.
- **⭐ THE SHARPENED DIAGNOSIS (the genuine resolution).** For a ⊥-chain, `iperm (tp dᵢ) s ⟺ tp dᵢ = isymRep`
  (R needs succ ⊥ [impossible], L needs the formula in `seqAnt s = ∅` [vacuous]). So `permIdx` = the FIRST
  `isymRep` premise, and (reading `iord_descent_red` lines 997–1080) `red` is a **fixpoint ⟺ the first
  `isymRep` premise is an atom/`zAx1` LEAF** (Ind/chain firsts reduce → descent; L-axioms are excluded by
  the selection invariant `tp_selected_isymRep_of_emptyAnt_botSucc`). **The defect is `permIdx`'s selection,
  not redex absence:** in the fixpoint case a genuine redex may still exist (LEFT disjunct of the dichotomy),
  but `red` ignores it because it picked the first leaf. So "fixpoint ⟹ cut-free ⟹ absurd" (the lap-120
  endgame plan) is FALSE; the descent must be driven by the EXHIBITED redex (`iord_descent_iRcrit_of_redex`),
  NOT by `red`'s permIdx.
- **THE PLAN (option a — restructure the endgame off `red`'s orbit).** Replace `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty`'s
  reliance on `iord_red_iterate_descends` (which carries the unprovable fixpoint branch) with a
  "some-reduction-descends" relation built from the dichotomy: LEFT → `iord_descent_iRcrit_of_redex` on the
  exhibited redex (needs the 6 ρ-facts); RIGHT → splice on the non-leaf premise (smaller ordinal, the
  existing `iord_descent_red` chain-REPLACE/`ZDerivation_red_zK_splice` machinery). Then well-foundedness of
  `iord` (PRWO ε₀) gives False with no fixpoint branch. (Option b — fix `permIdx` to skip leaves — is an
  engine redesign; option a reuses everything banked laps 121–123.)

**NEXT-LAP TARGETS (in order):**
1. **[lap 124] The 6 ρ-facts on the exhibited redex** (LEFT branch) — redex-premise reduct soundness:
   redexI is an I-rule (R-symbol, reduct via `zsubst`/haux0), redexJ is a §5 L-axiom (reduct `Ax¹`). These
   are the `hρlt`/`hρg`/`hρNF` inputs `iord_descent_iRcrit_of_redex` needs. Partially banked (haux0/haux1).
2. Wire the dichotomy LEFT branch (redex + ρ-facts) into a `false`-driving descent independent of `red`.
3. Sibling: `zKValidF_iIndReduct_of_zInd` (lap-120: false as stated; fix via `zsubst`). Then
   `foundation_bot_to_Z_empty` (M2) + `gentzenDescentφ`.
2. ✅ DONE (lap 122, 3rd commit) — `iord_descent_iRcrit_of_chain_reroute` (InternalZ, right after the
   reroute finder): the reroute twin of `iord_descent_iRcrit_of_chain'`, manufactures the redex via the
   generalized finder and feeds `iord_descent_iRcrit_of_redex`. Stall-free K-descent for valid ⊥-chains,
   modulo `hreroute`. Only target #1 (discharge `hreroute` for chain/Ind) now gates path (i).
3. Re-point the endgame `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` (M3) strict-descent disjunct onto this stall-free track
   (cf. lap-121 note: `iR2`-track and `red`-track share the ordinal `iord_iRcritG_eq_iRcrit`).
4. Sibling (independent of the stall): `zKValidF_iIndReduct_of_zInd` (lap-120 found it false as stated;
   fix = instance-correct Ind reduct via `zsubst`). Then `foundation_bot_to_Z_empty` (M2) + `gentzenDescentφ`.

## lap 121 — the stall SPLITS: junk-beyond-j0 is provably harmless; only threaded atom ≤ j0 is open
**Build 🟢 1326; new lemma axiom-clean `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`.** Banked
`iord_descent_iR2_zK_of_validF_critUpTo` (InternalZ, right after `iord_descent_iR2_zK_of_valid`).

**THE FINDING (sharpens lap-120's monolithic stall).** `iord_descent_iR2_zK_of_valid` destructures
`zKValid`'s GLOBAL criticality conjunct `hnperm0 : ∀ i < lh ds, ¬iperm(tp dᵢ) s`, but its proof body
applies it ONLY at indices `i ≤ j0` (the `isChainInf` exit; see InternalZ:8045 in the original). So the
ordinal descent goes through under the strictly weaker `hcrit : ∀ i ≤ j0, ¬iperm(tp dᵢ) s` — that is the
new lemma. **Consequence:** `isChainInf` constrains only premises `0..j0`; therefore a `red`-stall caused
by a **junk** permissible premise (`tp=isymRep`, e.g. a spurious identity atom A→A) at an index `> j0` is
HARMLESS to the genuine `iR2`/redex descent — the redex lives in `0..j0` and the new lemma reduces it
regardless of any junk beyond it. lap-120 conflated this junk case with the genuinely-hard threaded case.

**THE OPEN CORE, now sharp.** The stall is genuinely open ONLY when an atom/`zAx1` premise sits AT an
index `≤ j0` AND is threaded (its antecedent is a real cut formula `B = chainAsucc ds i'`, `i' < idx`).
That breaks `hcrit` at that index, so the redex finder (`inference_critical_pair_of_chain_tp`, needs
`hnperm` up to j0) does not apply, and the atom is a genuine cut against an axiom `B→B` → needs axiom-cut
elimination (the lap-120 prescription stands, but now scoped to a strictly smaller case).

**REACHABILITY of the open core (kernel-grounded structural facts, lap 121).** For a valid ⊥-chain
(`zKValidF s r ds`, `seqAnt s=∅`, `seqSucc s=⊥`) the threading at i=0 (no earlier premises, `seqAnt s=∅`)
FORCES premise 0 to have empty antecedent ⟹ premise 0 is NOT `zAtom`/`zAxAll`/`zAxNeg`/`zAx1` (all need a
formula in their antecedent) ⟹ premise 0 ∈ {I-rule, chain, Ind}. So a threaded atom (`hcrit` breaker) is
always at index `> 0`, with its cut formula `B` produced by an earlier non-isymRep premise (I-rule succ =
`∀p`/`¬A` compound, or L-axiom `zAxNeg` succ = arbitrary incl. `⊥`). Whether a COMPLETE valid ⊥-chain
with a threaded atom ≤ j0 as its first-`isymRep` premise actually exists is STILL unverified — the global
exit-to-⊥ constraint fights it (you must thread the cut formulas all the way to a `⊥`-succedent premise,
and an atom B→B passes B through without progress). lap-120 asserted "reachable" from a LOCAL type-system
argument but never exhibited a full valid witness; this is the decisive sub-question.

**LEVER banked (lap 121, 3rd commit): `iord_descent_iRcrit_of_redex`.** The K-cut descent computation
uses the criticality data (`hwfR/hwfL/hperm/hnperm`) ONLY to run `inference_critical_pair_of_chain` and
manufacture a redex; the actual ordinal descent (`redexCode → iord_descent_iCritReduct_object`) needs
just (a) an EXHIBITED redex pair below the finder sentinel, (b) `1 ≤ r`, (c) the six `ρ`-facts. Extracted
that as `iord_descent_iRcrit_of_redex`; `iord_descent_iRcrit_of_chain'` is now a thin wrapper.
**Significance:** in the threaded-atom stall, `hnperm` is broken (the atom is permissible ≤ j0), so the
finder route is blocked — but if the principal-cut redex can be exhibited ANOTHER way, descent still
fires, IGNORING the atom. So the open core reduces to: *exhibit a `(isymR, isymLk)` redex pair in a
valid ⊥-chain that has a threaded atom*. Probe `ZRegular`: NEGATIVE — `zReg` is eigenvar-freshness
(`zRegNext` atom-branch = 0), orthogonal to the atom-stall; regularity does NOT exclude it.

**CONCRETE NEXT-LAP TARGET (sharpened by the lever):** prove a valid ⊥-chain with a threaded
atom/`zAx1` at index `k ≤ j0` (cut formula `B = chainAsucc i'`, `i' < k`, from `chainAsucc_threaded_of_leaf`)
contains a genuine `(isymR, isymLk)` redex pair within `0..j0`. If the upstream producer `i'` of `B` is
an I-rule (`tp = isymR(B)`, B = `∀p`/`¬A` compound), look for the matching `isymLk` consumer of `B`; the
exit-to-⊥ threading should force one. If found → feed `iord_descent_iRcrit_of_redex` → descent, the atom
is harmless, STALL DISSOLVED with no engine surgery. If genuinely absent → the atom-removal reduction
(lexicographic `(iord, length)` measure) is forced. THREE paths: (i) redex-exhibition [above, cheapest];
(ii) atom-removal reduction + length measure; (iii) re-tag atoms off `isymRep` (deep, wide ripple).

**⭐ COMBINATORIAL CHARACTERIZATION (lap 121, 4th finding — the decisive sub-decomposition).** Read the
redex finder `inference_critical_pair` (InternalZ:507) line by line. Its `hnperm` (criticality up to j0)
has THREE clauses: `¬(isymR(Cmain) ∨ isymLk-at-Γmain ∨ isymRep)`. The proof uses them as:
- **isymR(Cmain) clause** — kills an I-rule at the exit j0 (Step A). For a ⊥-chain this is GENUINE and
  always holds: `isymR(Cmain)=isymR(⊥)` needs succedent `⊥`, but I-rules have compound succ `∀p`/`¬A`. ✓
- **isymLk-at-Γmain clause** — gives `B ∉ Γmain` for the least left-symbol. For a ⊥-chain `Γmain=∅`, so
  this is FREE (nothing is in ∅). ✓
- **isymRep clause** — used at TWO spots: the exit j0 (Step A) and the least-left-symbol's chain-source i
  (line 562). **This is the ONLY clause a threaded atom breaks.**
So the redex finder fails for a threaded-atom ⊥-chain ⟺ an `isymRep` leaf is the exit j0 OR is the
chain-source of the least left-symbol. Everything else goes through unchanged.

**THE FIX (named, buildable next lap): generalize `inference_critical_pair` by REPLACING its `isymRep`
clause with re-routing.** Replace `hnperm`'s isymRep clause with: *every `isymRep` leaf `i ≤ j0` has an
earlier duplicate succedent* `∃ i' < i, Asucc i' = Asucc i` — which is EXACTLY
`chainAsucc_threaded_of_leaf`'s conclusion (already banked). Then:
- **Sub-lemma A (least non-isymRep exit): ✅ DONE lap 121** — `exit_nonRep_of_reroute` (InternalZ, after
  `chainAsucc_threaded_of_leaf`), axiom-clean. The LEAST index `j' ≤ j0` with `chainAsucc ds j' = chainAsucc
  ds j0 ∈ {seqSucc s, ⊥}` is NOT `isymRep` (re-route ⟹ smaller exit ⟹ ⊥ vs minimality). **Definability
  fix worth remembering:** `definability`/aesop LOOPS on `chainAsucc` (depth-3 `seqSucc∘fstIdx∘znth`,
  rule-application-depth cap) — the cure was (i) add the generic instance `chainAsucc_definable' (Γ) :
  Γ-[m+1]-Function₂ := chainAsucc_definable.of_sigmaOne` (mirrors `zsubstTable_definable'`; THIS is what
  lets the comp lemmas fire — bare `𝚺₁-Function₂` literal-1 instance is not found by `Γ-[m+1]` synthesis),
  then (ii) hand-build the predicate def: `apply Definable.and ?_ (by definability); exact DefinableRel.comp
  (by definability) (DefinableFunction₂.comp (F := chainAsucc) (DefinableFunction.const ds)
  (DefinableFunction.var 0)) (DefinableFunction.const c)` after `set c := chainAsucc ds j0; clear_value c`.
- **Sub-lemma B (non-isymRep chain-source):** when the least-left-symbol's source `i` would be `isymRep`,
  re-route via the duplicate to a `< i` index; iterate (least-number) to a non-isymRep source. ⚠️ Caveat:
  that source may be `isymLk` (an L-axiom with succ B), not `isymR(B)` — so the re-routed redex needs an
  `isymR(B)` producer; if the threading bottoms out at an L-axiom, this sub-case still needs care (the
  genuine residual). Premise 0 is an I-rule/chain/Ind (empty antecedent, banked reasoning), which bounds
  the recursion.
- Then feed the exhibited redex to `iord_descent_iRcrit_of_redex` (banked this lap) ⟹ descent, STALL
  DISSOLVED for the threaded-atom case, no engine surgery. This is the concrete program for lap 122.

**NEXT-LAP TARGETS (in order):**
0. **[lap 122] Execute the generalized redex finder** (`inference_critical_pair_of_botChain_reroute`):
   Sub-lemma A first (cleanest, fully provable), then Sub-lemma B. Feeds `iord_descent_iRcrit_of_redex`.
1. **Decide reachability of the threaded-atom-≤-j0 core.** Either (a) prove a valid ⊥-chain's
   first-`isymRep` premise within `0..j0` is reducible (zTag ∈ {3,4}, never atom/`zAx1`) — would DISSOLVE
   the stall and let the endgame run on `iord_descent_iR2_zK_of_validF_critUpTo` + a "critical-up-to-j0
   OR has-reducible-isymRep-≤-j0" dichotomy; or (b) construct the witness ⟹ axiom-cut elimination forced.
   Attack via the exit-to-⊥ threading: does reaching a `⊥`-succedent premise force an isymRep cut/Ind ≤ j0?
2. **Wire the junk case into the endgame.** Use the new lemma: a valid ⊥-chain that is critical-up-to-j0
   (no isymRep premise ≤ j0) descends under `iR2` — independent of `red`'s permIdx stall. This is the
   `Or.inr` (strict-descent) closer of `iord_descent_red`'s analogue on the `iR2` track for the junk case.
   ⚠️ Note: `iR2`-track descent and `red`-track descent share the ordinal (`iord_iRcritG_eq_iRcrit`); the
   endgame `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` currently routes through `red`/`iord_red_iterate_descends` — consider
   re-pointing the strict-descent disjunct onto the `iR2` track where the junk case is already handled.

112–119 proved critical-cut soundness on both polarities (Buchholz §5). That was reduct SOUNDNESS.

**THE FINDING — `red` STALLS, so `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` cannot close.** The endgame
`false_of_ZDerivesEmpty {z} (hz : ZDerivesEmptyR z) : False` (`Crux2Blueprint:1144`) is a bare sorry whose
docstring claims it "closes either way" (fixpoint→cut-free→absurd OR infinite→PRWO). But `red` can be a
FIXPOINT on the ⊥-orbit: `permIdx` selects the first premise with `iperm isymRep`, which is unconditionally
true, so an ATOM (or `zAx1`) leaf can be selected → `red (zK s r ds) = zK s r ds` (banked
`red_zK_fixpoint_of_atom_selected`/`_zAx1_selected`) → a tag-4 K-node that is NOT cut-free. The repo flags
this in `RedZKDescent.lean`'s own docstring ("the orbit STALLS … an atom CAN be the first permissible
premise … fix = `permIdx` refinement OR an atom-free embedding"). **Lap-111's disjunctive `iord_descent_red`
(`red d = d ∨ iord ≺`) did NOT fix the stall — it RELOCATED it** into the unbuilt `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty`
sorry (the stall branches close `Or.inl`). Same defect as laps 104/107, still open 13 laps later.

**KEEP doing:** discharge the inversion → `redSound` (the swap is genuinely needed for the RIGHT disjunct).
**STOP:** treating the atomic engine swap as the SOLE next target before the stall is de-risked; asserting
`false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` "closes either way" while (A)+(B) are unbuilt.

**HIGHEST-VALUE NEXT TARGET — (A) `red w = w ∧ ZDerivesEmptyR w ⟹ False`** (fixpoint-absurdity). Decompose
the endgame into named leaves (mirrors how `redSound` was decomposed):
- **(A) fixpoint-absurdity:** `no_red_fixpoint_of_ZDerivesEmptyR : ZDerivesEmptyR w → red w ≠ w`.
  **⚠️ KERNEL-GROUNDED REFINEMENT (lap-120 scouting): the VACUITY route FAILS — do NOT pursue it.** The
  repo's leaf-soundness (`zTag_reducible_of_emptyAnt`, `zTag_Ind_or_K_of_ZDerivesEmpty`, InternalZ:8377/8480)
  only kills axiom leaves whose WHOLE antecedent is empty. But the *selected premise* of a ∅→⊥ K-node has its
  own sequent `sᵢ`, and `isChainInf` (InternalZ:1177, the chain-validity threading) lets premise antecedents
  contain CUT FORMULAS: `∀ B, inAnt B (chainAnt ds i) → inAnt B (seqAnt s) ∨ ∃ i'<i, B = chainAsucc ds i'`.
  With `seqAnt s = ∅`, premise-antecedent formulas are exactly the `chainAsucc` (cut) formulas. So a selected
  atom `zAtom sᵢ` can be a **valid axiom `B→B`** (`seqAnt sᵢ = {B}`, `seqSucc sᵢ = B = chainAsucc ds i'`,
  satisfying atom-validity `inAnt (seqSucc sᵢ) (seqAnt sᵢ)`). The atom's antecedent need NOT be empty — the
  empty-antecedent contradiction does not fire. **The stall is genuinely reachable in the engine's type
  system; `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` is unprovable as the engine stands.**
- **THE RESOLUTION (faithful Gentzen; = the deferred lap-104/107 prescription):** a selected axiom premise
  `B→B` means the K-node's cut on `B` is **against an axiom**, which Gentzen ELIMINATES (the cut vanishes,
  leaving the matching `B`-succedent premise). The engine's current Rep-reduce is the IDENTITY here
  (`tpReduce_isymRep`), so it STALLS instead of eliminating the axiom-cut. **Fix = extend `red` to reduce the
  axiom-cut** (when `permIdx` selects a genuine axiom `B→B`, splice in the matching `B`-succedent premise and
  drop the cut), guaranteeing progress. This is the "find+reduce the lowest cut" redesign from laps 104/107,
  now pinned to the precise mechanism (axiom-cut not eliminated). Selection-refinement alone (skip atoms) is
  INSUFFICIENT — the B-cut must still be reduced. An M2 orbit-invariant (axiom-free spine) is fragile (a B→B
  axiom is a normal sub-derivation, hard to exclude globally). PROBE whether `ZRegular w` constrains it, but
  expect the axiom-cut reduction to be the real fix.
- **⚠️⚠️ FURTHER REFINEMENT (lap-120, deeper scouting of `iperm`) — a CONCRETE provable sub-target emerges.**
  At the ⊥-orbit conclusion `s` (`seqAnt s = ∅`, `seqSucc s = ^⊥`), `iperm (tp dᵢ) s` (def InternalZ:976:
  `tp = isymR(seqSucc s) ∨ (isymLk k A ∧ A∈ant s) ∨ tp = isymRep`) holds **iff `tp dᵢ = isymRep`**: the
  `isymR(⊥)` disjunct needs a premise with succedent `⊥` (I-rules have succedent `∀p`/`¬A`, never `⊥`), and
  the `isymLk` disjunct needs the L-formula `∈ ant s = ∅` (impossible). So at a ⊥-orbit K-node the PERMISSIBLE
  premises are exactly the `isymRep` ones (atoms / Ind / K / `zAx1`); I-rules and L-axioms are NON-permissible.
  `permIdx` = first `isymRep` premise. **The decisive sub-question:** can that first-`isymRep` premise be an
  ATOM? If the atom is at **index 0**, the `isChainInf` threading (`∀ B, inAnt B (chainAnt 0) → inAnt B ∅ ∨
  ∃ i'<0, …`) forces its antecedent EMPTY (no earlier cut formulas) ⟹ atom-validity `inAnt (seqSucc sᵢ) ∅`
  FAILS ⟹ **vacuity fires after all.** So the stall requires the atom to be first-`isymRep` at **index > 0**,
  with every earlier premise NON-permissible (I-rules `isymR(C≠⊥)` / L-axioms `isymLk`), and the atom's
  antecedent `= {chainAsucc i'}` for some `i' < permIdx`. **CONCRETE NEXT-LAP TARGET:** prove the first-`isymRep`
  premise of a valid ⊥-orbit chain is forced to index 0 (or otherwise forces the vacuity-firing empty
  antecedent) — via the chain structure / `ZRegular` / the exit `j0` (`chainAsucc j0 = ^⊥`). If provable →
  (A) closes by vacuity, **no engine surgery**. If a genuine index-`>0` atom-stall chain is constructible →
  the axiom-cut elimination is forced. The question is now sharp and in-kernel decidable — attack
  `red_zK_fixpoint_of_atom_selected`'s reachability, not the abstract claim.
- **(B) no cut-free `∅→⊥`:** standard; only needed if (A) routes through "cut-free" rather than direct
  sequent-shape absurdity.
- **(C) descent-internalization:** `gentzenDescentφ` as the real Σ₁ graph of `n ↦ iord(red^[n] z)`. Probably
  routine Σ₁-recursion in IΣ₁ (one fixed function `red`, internally iterable via sequence coding). Lower risk.
- Then assemble `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` = (A) [the orbit can't fixpoint] composed with descent+PRWO [RIGHT].

**Why (A) over the swap:** hardest-first = attack the piece whose FEASIBILITY is in doubt. The swap wires
banked lemmas (feasible). (A) is a flagged defect with no built resolution (feasibility unknown), it is on
the M3 critical path, it is additive/independent of the swap, and it is DECISIVE: prove it → de-risk the
whole endgame; refute it → forces a selection-architecture fix BEFORE more swap investment.

### ⚠️⚠️⚠️ lap-120 (cont) FINDING — `zKValidF_iIndReduct_of_zInd` is FALSE as stated (Ind-case instance defect, KERNEL-GROUNDED)
Broadened off the stall thread (per `how-to-get-unblocked.md`) to the most self-contained of the 8 sorries —
the Ind-case validity `zKValidF_iIndReduct_of_zInd` (`Crux2Blueprint:79`). It is **false as stated**, for the
SAME structural reason as lap-114's critical-reduct bug (ordinal-invariant reduct that loses the instance):
- **Reduct structure (VERIFIED in-kernel, `scratchpad/indtest2.lean`):** `iIndReductSeq d0 d1 1 = ⟨d1, d0⟩`
  (`znth 0 = d1`, `znth 1 = d0`, `lh = 2`).
- **`zIndWff` succedents (definitional, InternalZ:`zIndWff`):** `seqSucc(fstIdx d1) = F(a+1)` where
  `a = qqFvar(zIndEig)` (a FREE eigenvariable); `seqSucc(fstIdx d0) = F(0)`; `seqSucc s = F(t)` where
  `t = zIndTerm` is a CLOSED term (`IsSemiterm ℒₒᵣ 0`). (`F(·) = substs1 · (zIndP)`.)
- **`isChainInf` exit fails:** the exit needs `chainAsucc j0 ∈ {seqSucc s = F(t), ^⊥}` for `j0 ∈ {0,1}`.
  `chainAsucc 0 = F(a+1)`: can't equal `F(t)` (closed `t` ≠ open `a+1`, different free vars) nor `⊥`.
  `chainAsucc 1 = F(0)`: equals `F(t)` only if `t = numeral 0`. So for any valid `zInd` concluding `F(t)`
  with `t ≠ 0` (e.g. `F(5)` — these exist), `isChainInf s (irk p) ⟨d1,d0⟩` is UNSATISFIABLE ⟹ the theorem
  is false.
- **ROOT CAUSE (= lap-114 pattern):** `iord` is instance-invariant, so the ordinal-DESCENT side
  (`iord_descent_red_zInd`, banked green) never caught this; the VALIDITY side (`zKValidF`) does. The
  verbatim-repeat `iIndReductSeq` (the SAME `d1` each copy, never re-instantiated at 0,1,…,t−1) cannot derive
  `F(t)`. Buchholz's Ind-elimination instantiates the step derivation along `0..t` — but `t` may be NON-
  STANDARD, so the faithful internal reduct is a single substitution-based chain whose validity needs an
  internal (Σ₁-in-V) induction, NOT a verbatim k-fold repeat.
- **FIX (next lap):** re-define the Ind reduct to be instance-correct (the eigenvar-substituted step chain to
  `t`), mirroring lap-114's re-principalization of the critical reduct (`zsubst d0 a (numeral k)`). Likely
  reuses `zsubst`/`ZDerivation_zsubst`. THEN `zKValidF_iIndReduct_of_zInd` (restated on the corrected reduct)
  becomes provable.
- **⚠️ SYSTEMIC HYPOTHESIS:** the "ordinal-invariant but validity-broken reduct" defect now appears in BOTH
  the critical reduct (lap-114, fixed) and the Ind reduct (this finding). **Audit the splice/replace reducts
  (`ZDerivation_red_zK_splice`, axNeg replace validity) for the same latent instance defect BEFORE trusting
  their `zKValidF`/`ZDerivation` obligations** — they may also be mis-stated, not merely hard.
  - **Sharpening:** the lap-114→119 instance-correction campaign (`critReductCorr`/`iRcritG`/`iRcritGNeg` via
    `zsubst d0 a (numeral k)`) corrected the **critical K-cut** reduct only. The **Ind** reduct (`iIndReductSeq`,
    `iRInd`) was NOT touched by that campaign — it kept the original verbatim-repeat shape — which is exactly
    why it retained the instance defect. So the concrete next-lap fix is: **extend the lap-114 re-principalization
    treatment to the Ind rule** (an eigenvar-substituted step chain reaching the conclusion instance `t`). The
    splice reduct CONSUMES the already-corrected critical halves, so it likely inherits the fix (lower risk); the
    axNeg replace ties to the lap-117/118 corrected ¬-inversion. Verify both, but expect the Ind reduct to be
    the genuine second mis-statement.

## lap 119 — the engine swap is NOT "pure wiring"; its O1 (regularity) front LANDED
**Build 🟢 green 1326; headline footprint intact (`[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]`, 0 math axioms).
1 commit. No sorries added.** See `HANDOFF-2026-06-26-lap119.md`.

**Attempted the lap-118 engine swap as prescribed** (`iRK` else-branch → `iRKcCrit`, `iRKDef`/`iRK_defined`
swap, `red_zK_crit ↦ iRKcCrit`). InternalZ compiles green standalone (`scratchpad/lap119-engine-swap.diff`),
but changing `red`'s critical value breaks FAR more than the baton's "2 consumers": the entire **O1 /
`ZRegular` front** (`ZRegular_red_zK_crit`/`_splice_of_chain`, Zsubst) was ABSENT from the lap-118 all-banked
table, and `ZRegular_red` is load-bearing (feeds `ZDerivesEmptyR` → M3). Plus the ~200-line RedZKDescent
descent re-key. Reverted to keep `src/` green; landed the missing O1 front additively.

**THE ADVANCE — regularity of the corrected reduct (all `Zsubst.lean`, all axiom-clean):**
- `zReg_zsubst` ALREADY EXISTED (substitution preserves regularity — the hard piece was done).
- `ZRegular_zsubst_zIallPrem` (I∀ child regular via `zReg_zsubst` + `zReg_zIall`),
  `ZRegular_zInegPrem` (I¬ child via `zReg_zIneg` heredity),
  `ZRegular_iRKcCrit` (whole corrected reduct regular; composes the slot facts; takes `htagI : zTag dᵢ∈{1,2}`).

**Front 1 (O1) now FULLY CLOSED additively (2nd commit):** `ZRegular_iRKcCrit_of_zK` (Zsubst) proves
`ZRegular (iRKcCrit (zK s r ds))` from `hZ`/`hreg`/`hvalid` alone — so once the swap lands,
`ZRegular_red_zK_crit` is `rw [red_zK_crit hcrit]; exact ZRegular_iRKcCrit_of_zK …`. Supplied by new
InternalZ orbit lemmas `isRedexPair_redexCode_of_zKValid` (full redex-pair certificate) +
`zTag_redexI_of_zKValid` (R-redex is an I-rule). All axiom-clean.

**Front 2 (descent) also brought to forms-parity (4th commit):** `iord_descent_iRKcCrit_corr` (∀) /
`_neg` (¬) (RedZKDescent) state the descent on `iRKcCrit (zK s r ds)` directly — via `iRKcCrit_eq_corr`/
`_eq_neg` → the banked `iord_descent_iRcritG_critReductCorr`/`_iRcritGNeg_critReductNeg`. Both axiom-clean.

**ALL THREE fronts now reduce to ONE shared residual — the `redZKReady` orbit bundle.** Regularity
(`ZRegular_iRKcCrit_of_zK`, front 1 ✅ fully self-contained from `hvalid`), descent
(`iord_descent_iRKcCrit_corr`/`_neg`) and soundness (`ZDerivation_iRcritG_critReductCorr`/
`_iRcritGNeg_critReductNeg`) ALL now need only the explicit redex forms: ∀ = `hdi : znth ds redexI =
zIall sᵢ a p d0`, `hdj : … = zAxAll sⱼ pj k'`, `hirk : irk(^∀pj) = irk(cutFormula)+1`; ¬ = `hdi : … =
zIneg sᵢ p d0`, `hdj : … = zAxNeg sⱼ p`, `hcut`, `hp`. (Descent only — regularity needs just `htagI`,
already discharged.)

**⭐ THE orbit bundle `redZKReady_of_zKValid` is EXTRACTED (9th commit) — the central multi-lap residual,
CLOSED.** From `hZ`/`hvalid` it produces `redexI < redexJ < lh ds` + the polarity-dispatched explicit redex
forms: ∀-pair (`zIall sᵢ a p d0` / `zAxAll sⱼ pj k'` + `irk(∀pj) = irk(cutFormula)+1`) ∨ ¬-pair (`zIneg sᵢ
p d0` / `zAxNeg sⱼ p` + `cutFormula = p` + `IsUFormula p`). Built from the banked blocks
(`isRedexPair_redexCode_of_zKValid` → `redexPair_tp` → `zDerivation_isymR_form`/`_isymLk_form`, cross-ruled
on the shared `A`); the `hirk` rank relation via `cutFormula_all`+`irk_substs1`+`irk_all`, the ¬ `pp=p` via
`neg_inj_iff`. Axiom-clean. **This is EXACTLY the `hdi`/`hdj`/`hirk`|`hcut`/`hp` that all three banked fronts
(`ZRegular_iRKcCrit_of_zK`, `iord_descent_iRKcCrit_corr`/`_neg`, `ZDerivation_iRcritG_critReductCorr`/
`_iRcritGNeg_critReductNeg`) consume.**

**NEXT — the atomic engine swap, now genuinely PURE WIRING (all suppliers banked).** Replay
`scratchpad/lap119-engine-swap.diff` (InternalZ: relocate `iRKcCrit`/`iRK`/`iRKcCritDef` before `iRNextG`;
`red_zK_crit ↦ iRKcCrit`; `not_zKCritical_red_zK ↦ _iRKcCrit`). Then re-prove the 3 consumers (build is RED
until all land — atomic):
- `ZRegular_red_zK_crit` (Zsubst): `rw [red_zK_crit hcrit]; exact ZRegular_iRKcCrit_of_zK hds hZ hreg hvalid`
  (the caller `ZRegular_red_zK` hcrit-branch already builds `hvalid`). `ZRegular_red_zK_splice_of_chain`
  reroutes its `iRcritG` premise reads via `iRKcCrit_eq_corr`/`_eq_neg`.
- `iord_descent_red_zK_crit` (RedZKDescent): `rw [red_zK_crit hcrit]`, then `rcases redZKReady_of_zKValid
  hZ hvalid` and dispatch to `iord_descent_iRKcCrit_corr`/`_neg`. (`iCrit_halves_descend` likewise re-keys.)
- `ZDerivation_red_zK_crit` (Crux2Blueprint sorry): restate to `ZDerivation (iRKcCrit (zK s r ds))`, `rcases
  redZKReady_of_zKValid hZ hvalid`, case on ∀/¬ → `iRKcCrit_eq_corr`/`_eq_neg` + the soundness capstones
  (need `hvalid` at the `redSoundGen` zK call site — from `zKValid_iff_zKValidF_and_zKCritical` + criticality).
Full plan in HANDOFF lap-119.

## lap 118 — ¬-case inversion's `hpmem` residual DISCHARGED; capstone now unconditional
**Build 🟢 green 1326; headline footprint intact (`[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]`, 0 math axioms).
1 commit (4aa7a44). No sorries added.** See `HANDOFF-2026-06-26-lap118.md`.

**Discharged the lap-117 ¬-side residual** `hpmem : inAnt A (seqAnt sⱼ)` (Buchholz 2.2's `A,¬A∈Γ`) by
**strengthening the `zAxNeg` (tag-6) ZPhi disjunct** with a 4th conjunct `inAnt p (seqAnt s)` — faithful to
Buchholz §5 case 2.2 (`Ax^{¬A,0}` genuinely carries both `A,¬A∈Γ`; `buchholz-gentzen.txt:903`). Full ZPhi
ripple done (`ZPhi`/`zphi_monotone`/`_strong_finite`/`zphi_iff`/`zblueprint` σ+π/`zPhi_definable` + rcases/
construction sites in `Crux2Blueprint`/`Zsubst`/`InternalZ`). `zDerivation_zAxNeg_inv` now returns both
memberships; `ZDerivation_corrected_haux0_neg` recovers `hpmem` in-proof; **`ZDerivation_iRcritGNeg_corrected_neg`
drops the `hpmem` hypothesis** (axiom-clean `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`). The ¬-side twin of lap-115's
`zAx1` 8th-disjunct discharge.

**ALSO banked this lap (3 more commits, all axiom-clean):** (a) **`iord_iRcritGNeg_eq_iRcrit`** descent twin
(`InternalZ`) — the ¬-branch re-point, via `inadd_comm`/`max_comm` on the swapped `seqUpdate` halves; (b)
**`critReductNeg`** (`InternalZ`, red-free) — the concrete ¬-case `ρ` (redexJ ↦ `zAx1 (seqSetSucc sⱼ A) A`,
redexI ↦ `zInegPrem dᵢ` = `d0`, a 𝚺₁ accessor not `red` — arithmetization-ready);
(c) **`ZDerivation_iRcritGNeg_critReductNeg`** (`Crux2Blueprint`) — concrete-`ρ` ¬-soundness, the
`critReductCorr` twin. **Both polarity reduct suppliers now soundness-certified against their concrete engine
`ρ`, and both descent re-points banked.**

**ALSO banked this lap (the dispatched reduct DEFINED + ARITHMETIZED — the hardest re-key piece):**
**`iRKcCrit d`** (`InternalZ`) — the fully-explicit polarity-dispatched critical reduct (`zTag dᵢ=1` → ∀
re-principalized `zsubst`+`Ax^1`-antgrow; else ¬ swapped-slot `Ax^1`-succset+`zInegPrem`), standalone
(table-free, red-free). Bridges `iRKcCrit_eq_corr`/`_eq_neg` → the soundness-certified
`iRcritG (critReductCorr)`/`iRcritGNeg (critReductNeg)`. **`iRKcCritDef` + `iRKcCrit_defined`** — the 𝚺₁
graph (closed first try, `by_cases` on `ti`, reusing `cutFormulaDef`'s `k=π₁(π₂(tp dⱼ))`+`numeralGraph`).
THE arithmetization wall is DOWN.

**ALSO banked this lap — the ¬-case DESCENT** `iord_descent_iRcritGNeg_critReductNeg` (`RedZKDescent`, the
twin of `iord_descent_iRcritG_critReductCorr`) + the sequent-general L-bundle `iRedDescent_zAx1_zAxNeg_gen`.
**ALL corrected-reduct lemmas are now BANKED for BOTH polarities** (arithmetization `iRKcCrit_defined`;
bridges `iRKcCrit_eq_corr`/`_eq_neg`; soundness `ZDerivation_iRcritG_critReductCorr`/`_iRcritGNeg_critReductNeg`;
iord re-points `iord_iRcritG_eq_iRcrit`/`_iRcritGNeg_eq_iRcrit`; descents
`iord_descent_iRcritG_critReductCorr`/`_iRcritGNeg_critReductNeg`). The engine swap is now PURE WIRING.

**NEXT (hardest-first):** the engine SWAP (atomic, one unit, breaks build mid-way — don't commit until green):
(3) re-key `iRK`'s critical branch `else iRKc d s` → `else iRKcCrit d` + `iRKDef`/`iRK_defined`; (4)
`red_zK_crit` SIMPLIFIES to `red (zK s r ds) = iRKcCrit (zK s r ds)`; (5) close `ZDerivation_red_zK_crit`
(restate target to `ZDerivation (iRKcCrit …)`) via `iRKcCrit_eq_corr`/`_eq_neg` + the two soundness lemmas —
the real residual is the `redZKReady` orbit bundle (`hdi`/`hdj`/`hIJ`/`hthread`/`hrank`/… derived at the call
site via `tp`-inversion `redexPair_tp`+`tp_isymR_form_wff`, itself an open sorry); (6) re-prove
`iord_descent_red_zK_crit` via the banked descent twins. Full 6-step list + the all-banked table in
HANDOFF lap-118.

## lap 117 — ¬-case critical-cut inversion SOUNDNESS proven; BOTH critical sub-cases complete
**Build 🟢 green 1326; headline footprint intact (`[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]`, 0 math axioms).
1 commit (9507db8). No sorries added; the ¬-case lemmas are axiom-clean `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`.**
See `HANDOFF-2026-06-26-lap117.md`.

**Closed the lap-116 CAVEAT (the I¬ R-redex sub-case).** Buchholz Def 3.2 case 5.1's ¬-subcase SWAPS the two
halves' redex assignment (`d{0}↦`L-redex `j`, `d{1}↦`R-redex `i`; the OPPOSITE of ∀), so `iRcritG` can't
express it ⟹ built a new swapped-half constructor **`iRcritGNeg`** (`InternalZ`) + `ZDerivation_iRcritGNeg_of`.
Proven sound: succedent half `ZDerivation_corrected_haux0_neg` (redexJ=axNeg ↦ §5 `Ax^1_{Γⱼ→A}`, Buchholz
Lemma 5.1 case 2.2) + antecedent half `ZDerivation_corrected_haux1_neg` (redexI=I¬ ↦ child `d0`,
`isChainInf_reduceR_membership` re-points the tip to the `⊥`-endform ⟹ arbitrary conclusion succedent OK) +
capstone `ZDerivation_iRcritGNeg_corrected_neg`.

**THE one residual** (the ¬-side twin of lap-116's `zAx1`-as-ZDerivation gate): `haux0_neg` needs
`hpmem : inAnt A (seqAnt sⱼ)` (Buchholz 2.2's `A,¬A∈Γ`), but the repo's `zAxNeg` ZPhi disjunct pins only
`¬A∈Γ`. **DISCHARGE = strengthen the `zAxNeg` (tag-6) ZPhi disjunct to also require `inAnt A (seqAnt s)`** —
a `ZPhi` ripple (`zphi_monotone`/`_strong_finite`/`zphi_iff`/`zblueprint` σ+π/`zPhi_definable` + ~64
`rcases zDerivation_iff.mp` axNeg arms, each +1 conjunct), mechanically mirroring the lap-116 `zAx1`
8th-disjunct work — OR derive `A∈Γⱼ` from the redex-pair chain context.

**NEXT (hardest-first):** the engine re-key, now de-risked on BOTH polarities — re-key `iRKc` to DISPATCH
(`zTag dᵢ = 1` → `iRcritG`+`critReductCorr`; I¬ → `iRcritGNeg`+ρ_neg) and emit the polarity-correct
constructor. Then `ZDerivation_red_zK_crit` closes via `red_zK_crit` + the two soundness capstones; descent
re-points (need an `iord_iRcritGNeg_eq_iRcrit` twin — short, `#` is commutative). See HANDOFF lap-117 steps.
Suggested sequencing: (a) strengthen `zAxNeg` disjunct (additive, removes `hpmem`), THEN (b) the re-key.

## lap 115 — the inversion's L-half PROVEN; gate = make `zAx1` a sound ZDerivation
**Build 🟢 green 1326; headline footprint intact (`[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]`, 0 math
axioms). 1 commit (L-half + finding). No sorries added.** See `HANDOFF-2026-06-25-lap115.md`.

**BOTH inversion halves now proven** (axiom-clean): R-half `ZDerivation_corrected_haux0` (lap 114) +
**L-half `ZDerivation_corrected_haux1`** (this lap). Grounded the L-side in verbatim **Buchholz §5 case 2.1**
(scratchpad `buchholz-gentzen.txt:903` — the missing source): the L-redex `axAll` axiom `Ax^{∀p,k}` (succedent
`F(k)`) reduces to the §5 **logical axiom** `dⱼ[0] = Ax^1_{F(k),Γⱼ→F(k)}` (antecedent gains `F(k)=cutFormula
d`). Engine reduct `v = zAx1 (seqAddAnt (cutFormula d) sⱼ) C`; `haux1` via `ZDerivation_iCritReplaceReduce_general`
(tag-7 ⟹ tag conjuncts vacuous), modulo two named §5 residuals — (O-L1) `hZredL` = `zAx1 …` is a ZDerivation;
(O-L2) `hci` = threading `isChainInf`.

**CRUX FINDING (extends lap-114 to L-side):** the engine reduct `zAxReduct (zAxAll sⱼ p k') = zAx1 sⱼ p` is
unfaithful in THREE ways — payload `p` vs `F(k)`, sequent `sⱼ` vs `seqAddAnt F(k) sⱼ`, and **`zAx1` (tag 7)
is not a `ZPhi` disjunct ⟹ not a ZDerivation at all**. All descent-invariant (why it hid through 108–113).

**NEXT-LAP TARGET (hardest-first — the gate for the whole inversion):** make `zAx1 s C` a sound ZDerivation
leaf — 8th `ZPhi` disjunct `(∃ s C, d = zAx1 s C ∧ inAnt (seqSucc s) (seqAnt s))`, mirroring `zAtom`. Ripple:
`ZPhi`/`zphi_monotone`/`_strong_finite`/`zphi_iff`/`zblueprint` σ+π (mirror `zAxNeg`, `zAx1Graph` exists)/
`zPhi_definable`; ~64 `rcases zDerivation_iff.mp` sites (mostly trailing tag-mismatch arms); +
`zDerivation_zAx1_intro`/`_inv`. Then (O-L1) closes; (O-L2) = lap-113 threading; THEN re-key `red`'s tag-4
critical branch to emit the corrected reducts (R: `numeral k`, L: `zAx1 (seqAddAnt F(k) sⱼ) (F(k))`) and
assemble `ZDerivation_red_zK_crit = ZDerivation_iRcritG_of haux0 haux1`. Full step list in the handoff.

## lap 114 — FRESH-MIND REVIEW: the inversion PRIZE is feasible (re-principalization), not a multi-year wall
**Build 🟢 green 1326; headline footprint intact + re-verified in-kernel (`[propext, sorryAx, choice,
Quot.sound]`, 0 math axioms). 1 commit (building block + finding).** See
`ANALYSIS-2026-06-25-lap114-inversion-instance-mismatch.md`.

**DIRECTION CHANGE (kernel-grounded).** The crux-2 prize `ZDerivation_red_zK_crit` (`Crux2Blueprint:100`)
— the critical-cut SOUNDNESS inversion, framed since lap 110 as "the multi-year cut-elim core, blueprint
`Zinfty.allInv`" — is **FALSE as stated** for a precise, FIXABLE reason. It delegates (via
`ZDerivation_iRcritG_of`, `InternalZ:8336`) to two stripped halves `haux0`/`haux1`; the outer chain's
validity is automatic (`zKValidF_iCritReductGen`). `haux0` concludes `Γ → cutFormula d = Γ → F(k)`, `k`
the L-redex (axAll) instance; its `isChainInf` threading FORCES the redexI premise to derive `F(k)`. But
`red`'s reduct there is `zsubst d0 a (numeral 0)` (instance **0**, `red_zIall`), deriving `F(0) ≠ F(k)`.
**So `red`'s critical reduct is unsound** — it loses the cut instance. (Instance-0 is correct for the
ordinal DESCENT — `iord` is instance-invariant, so `iord_descent_red` survives — which is why this hid in
plain sight through laps 108–113.) This is lap-104's `red_redAllEx_eq` re-principalization finding, now
pinned to the live engine.

**THE FIX (contained, building blocks BANKED):** the critical reduct's R-redex (I∀) premise must be
`zsubst d0 a (numeral k)` (k = `π₁(π₂(tp (redexJ d)))`, the same `k` `cutFormula` reads). Then:
- succedent `= cutFormula d` by **`seqSucc_zsubst_zIall_premise`** (`Zsubst.lean`, BANKED this lap,
  axiom-clean — the linchpin), modulo eigenvariable freshness `hpfresh : fvSubst a (numeral k) p = p` (O3).
- derivability by `ZDerivation_zsubst_zIall_premise` (`Zsubst.lean:1879`, banked), modulo `maxEigen d0 < a` (O1).
- I¬ redex needs no change (`red_zIneg = d0`, no instance).

So the inversion is a `red`-redefinition (re-key the tag-4 critical branch of `iRNextG`/`iRNext` to
substitute the L-redex `k`), NOT new deep machinery.

**NEXT-LAP TARGET (hardest-first, the headline-critical path):**
1. Implement the corrected critical reduct: re-key `iRNextG`/`iRNext` tag-4 so `ρ (redexI)` substitutes
   `numeral k` (k from `tp (redexJ d)`) for the I∀ R-redex, leaving I¬/`zAxReduct` as is. Re-check the
   `red_zK_crit` equation + `𝚺₁`-definability (`iRNextDef`). Descent is instance-invariant ⟹ transfers.
2. Prove `haux0`/`haux1` (the threading reconstruction — `isChainInf` for `seqUpdate ds redexI (corrected
   reduct)` at the new conclusion succedent; inherited from the original chain's `isChainInf` restricted
   to `≤ redexI`, analogous to `ZDerivation_iCritReplaceReduce_of`). Succedent identity is banked.
3. Thread the orbit freshness data (O1/O3) through the `redSound` motive (same obligations the replace
   branch already isolates, lap-99/100).
Then `ZDerivation_red_zK_crit` is REAL → unblocks `redSound`. The chain-REPLACE IH / ⊥-orbit invariant
(lap-113 next step) is the OTHER deep piece, but the inversion is higher-value (it is the cut-elim content
and was the avoided piece per lap-111) and now demonstrably contained.

## lap 113 — splice branch CLOSED; chain-rank invariant PROVEN; NEXT = the iord_descent_red recursion
**Build 🟢 green 1326; headline footprint intact (`[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]`, 0 math axioms).
4 commits.** The splice `hr'` degree-drop is fully proven and `irk_chainAsucc_redexI_le` (the chain-rank
invariant) is a real axiom-clean proof (NO `isChainInf` refactor — pairing joint-monotonicity bounds the
minimal redex below `j₀`). `iord_descent_red` is down to **ONE** internal sorry.

**THE remaining sorry = the chain-REPLACE strong-induction IH** (`Crux2Blueprint:~595`,
`Or.inr (iord_descent_red_zK_chain_replace … ?_)`): needs `iRedDescent (red dᵢ) dᵢ` for a non-critical
chain premise `dᵢ`, i.e. the recursive IH of `iord_descent_red` on `dᵢ`.

**THE FIX = restructure `iord_descent_red` to conclude `iRedDescent` + strong induction.** Concretely:
1. Prove `iRedDescent_red_of_ZDerivation (d) : ZDerivation d → red d = d ∨ iRedDescent (red d) d` by
   `induction d using ISigma1.sigma1_order_induction` (premises `dᵢ < d` via `znth ds i < ds < zK s r ds`).
   `iord_descent_red` then = a 3-line corollary (`iord_descent_of_iRedDescent` on the RIGHT disjunct).
2. **Per-branch `iRedDescent` bundles** (every K-node reduct factors through `iord_descent_le` =
   `idg_le ∧ iotil_lt ∧ nf`, so the bundles ALWAYS exist):
   - atom / axAll / axNeg: `red d = d` ⟹ LEFT (`red_zAtom`/`red_zAxAll`/`red_zAxNeg`). ✓ trivial
   - I∀ / I¬: `iRedDescent_red_zIall` / (`red_zIneg ▸ iRedDescent_zIneg`). ✓ banked
   - **REPLACE**: `iRedDescent_red_zK_replace_eq` — **DONE this lap** (`RedZKDescent`). chain-replace branch
     feeds it the IH (`dᵢ < d`); if IH gives LEFT (`red dᵢ = dᵢ`) the whole node is a fixpoint (LEFT).
   - **SPLICE**: needs `iRedDescent_red_zK_splice_eq` — TODO: same as `iord_descent_red_zK_splice_eq` but
     also prove the reduct's own NF `isNF (iotil (zK s' r' (seqInsert ds i a b)))` via a case analysis on
     `znth_seqInsert_{pre,at,at1,suf}` (a/b are NF by `hNFa`/`hNFb`, ds-premises by `hNF`). ~15 lines; the
     other two fields = `idg_seqInsert_le'` / `iotil_seqInsert_lt`.
   - **Ind**: needs `iRedDescent_red_zInd` — `iord_descent_iRInd_zInd` goes through `iord_descent_iIndReduct`;
     check it factors through `iord_descent_le`/`iord_descent_iCritAux` to expose the bundle.
   - **critical NODE** (`hcrit` false, `red = iRcritG`): needs the bundle from `iord_descent_red_zK_crit`
     (`RedZKDescent:84`) — same factoring check.
3. **Definability:** `sigma1_order_induction` needs the motive `𝚺₁-Predicate` (`red`/`idg`/`iotil` are
   `𝚺₁-Function₁`, `ZDerivation` is `𝚫₁`); try `definability`, fall back to explicit `.comp₂` per the
   `definability-aesop-depth-blowup` note.

### ⚠️ KEY FINDINGS (lap 113, 2nd half) — the naive `iRedDescent` recursion is WRONG; two real obstacles
Banked all K-node `iRedDescent` bundles (`iRedDescent_red_zK_replace_eq`/`_splice_eq`/`_chain_replace`/
`_chain_splice`; Ind is `iRedDescent_zInd`). But TWO kernel-grounded facts show the general theorem
`ZDerivation d → red d = d ∨ iRedDescent (red d) d` is **FALSE as stated**:

- **(A) The critical-NODE reduct breaks `iRedDescent`.** `red (critical zK) = iRcrit = cut`, whose descent
  is `iord_descent_cut` (`InternalZ:2596`): `idg e + 1 ≤ idg d` (degree DROPS) with
  `icmp (iotil e) (ocOadd (iotil d) 1 0) = 0` (i.e. `õ(e) < ω^{õ(d)}` — `õ` may RISE!). So `iRedDescent`'s
  `otil_lt` (`õ(e) < õ(d)`) FAILS for the cut. ⟹ the theorem must EXCLUDE critical K-chains: condition it
  on `¬ (zTag d = 4 ∧ ¬ permIdx d < lh (zKseq d))`. The recursion preserves this: the IH is only applied
  at chain-REPLACE (`Crux2Blueprint:599`), where the premise `dᵢ` is a NON-critical chain (`h2` true);
  critical premises are SPLICED (`iCrit_halves`, no IH), and splice KEEPS `õ` descending
  (`iotil_seqInsert_lt`) — that's the whole point of splicing-not-cutting.

- **(B) axAll/axNeg-SELECTED premise → neither disjunct holds (the lap-111 selection invariant, now in
  general sub-chains).** If a non-critical node's `permIdx`-selected premise `dᵢ` has `tp = isymLk`
  (tag 5/6 axAll/axNeg, which ARE `red`-fixpoints `red dᵢ = dᵢ`), then `red_zK_rep_nonchain` gives
  `red node = zK (tpReduce (isymLk…) s 0) r ds` — premises `ds` UNCHANGED (so `õ(red node) = õ(node)`,
  `idg` equal ⟹ `iRedDescent.otil_lt` FAILS) but the CONCLUSION is reduced (`tpReduce isymLk ≠ id`, unlike
  `tpReduce_isymRep` for atoms ⟹ NOT a fixpoint either). So a general non-critical node with an L-axiom
  selected satisfies NEITHER `red d = d` NOR `iRedDescent`. For the `∅→⊥` TOP node this is killed by Cor 2.1
  (`tp_selected_isymRep_of_emptyAnt_botSucc`: the selected premise of a `∅→⊥` K-node has `tp = isymRep`,
  never `isymLk`). **The open question: does that selection invariant PROPAGATE through the reduction to
  every sub-chain the recursion visits?** If the reduced sub-chains stay `⊥`-succedent orbits, Cor 2.1
  reapplies and axAll/axNeg are never selected; then the recursion closes. This is the genuine remaining
  content — an INVARIANT (`⊥`-orbit / selected-`tp = isymRep`) threaded through `red`, NOT a mechanical
  strong induction. Likely the right statement: prove the recursion for chains whose conclusion succedent
  is `⊥` (or carries the orbit invariant), so both (A)'s criticality and (B)'s L-axiom selection are
  controlled. Re-examine the lap-107/111 `ZInf`/`ZcOK` prototype inversion cases for the invariant shape.

Once `iord_descent_red` is sorry-free, the open frontier = the PRIZE (`ZDerivation_red_zK_crit` inversion)
+ validity sorries (`zKValidF_iIndReduct_of_zInd`, splice/axNeg validity) + M2/M3.


## lap 111 — DEEP REFLECTION + disjunctive `iord_descent_red` (atom branch CLOSED; SELECTION INVARIANT named)
**Build 🟢 green 1326; headline footprint intact + re-verified in-kernel (`[propext, sorryAx, choice,
Quot.sound]`, 0 math axioms). 2 commits (synthesis + grind).** See `REFLECTION-2026-06-25-lap111.md`.

**Landed (grind):** `iord_descent_red` retyped to the disjunctive `red d = d ∨ icmp (iord (red d)) (iord d) =
0` (and `iord_red_iterate_descends` to the matching per-step dichotomy). Working branches → `Or.inr`. **Atom
branch genuinely closed** via `Or.inl (red_zK_fixpoint_of_atom_selected …)` (a TRUE node-fixpoint:
`tp=isymRep`, `tpReduce_isymRep s 0 = s`).

**axAll/axNeg CLOSED via the SELECTION INVARIANT — which already existed.** axAll/axNeg (tags 5/6) are NOT
clean node-fixpoints (`red dᵢ=dᵢ` but `tp=isymLk` strips the conclusion while `iord` is unchanged ⟹ neither
disjunct holds), so they close ONLY by vacuity. The vacuity is Cor 2.1, **already proved**:
`tp_selected_isymRep_of_emptyAnt_botSucc` (`InternalZ:7163`) — the selected premise of a `∅→⊥` K-node has
`tp = isymRep`, but an L-axiom has `tp = isymLk ≠ isymRep`. Both branches discharged by `exfalso` + that
lemma. No new infrastructure needed.

**⚠ HONESTY CORRECTION:** the disjunctive form resolved `iord_descent_red` but RELOCATED the atom-stall to
M3. The atom branch's `Or.inl` is GENUINELY true — the orbit can reach a `red`-FIXPOINT at an atom(Rep)-
selected ∅→⊥ K-node (atom = Rep, Cor 2.1 PERMITS it; only axAll/axNeg are vacuous). So `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty`
must handle a STALLING orbit (a fixpoint K-node is not cut-free ⟹ neither "infinite descent" nor "cut-free
absurd" fires). True fix is engine/embedding-level: (a) refine `permIdx`/`isPermPrem` to skip Rep premises, or
(b) M2 produces chains with no index-0 Rep/atom. The 2nd grind commit msg's "fully resolved" overstated it.

**Residual `sorry`s in `iord_descent_red` (2, was 5 at lap start) — both deep, confirmed this lap:**
1. **chain-REPLACE IH** — the chain-spine strong induction. Hits **lap-101's wall**: chain premises have
   GROWING antecedents (not ∅→⊥) ⟹ Cor 2.1 doesn't reapply ⟹ inner axAll/axNeg/atom can't use empty-ant
   vacuity. Needs the permIdx-skip-Rep refinement (a).
2. **splice `hr'`** — needs the lap-110 cut-formula strip. CONFIRMED no shortcut: `zKValidF` gives only
   `irk (chainAsucc ds i) ≤ r` (non-strict, `InternalZ:1290/1299`); `idg(parent) = max(r, iseqMaxIdg ds − 1)`
   off by one. Strip is LOCALIZED to `iRcritG`'s cut-formula arg (`InternalZ:6427`: `chainAsucc (zKseq d)
   (redexI d)` = principal → a `cutFormula d` = stripped `A(d)`). Ripples to `ZDerivation_iRcritG_of` /
   `ZDerivation_red_zK_crit` (both already sorry) + splice `irk`; descent lemmas IMMUNE (lap-110). Closes via
   `irk_cut_lt_rank_forall`/`_neg` (`InternalZ:411`). **This strip ALSO unblocks the inversion prize (`:96`).**

**Recommended next-lap order:** cut-formula strip (2) — unblocks `hr'` + the inversion prize; then the
permIdx-skip-Rep refinement (1)+(a) — dissolves the chain-spine wall AND the M3 atom-stall at once.

Then the prize: ∀/¬-INVERSION (`ZDerivation_red_zK_crit`, template `Zinfty.allInv`); then M3
`false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` (fixpoint-or-descent endgame: a `red`-fixpoint ⊥-orbit is cut-free ⟹ absurd; else
infinite ε₀-descent ⟹ PRWO) + M2 embedding; then wire → headline (ONLY when `#print axioms` clean).

## lap 110 — splice branch: 6 of 7 sub-sorries CLOSED; `hr'` isolated as the degree-drop residual
**Build 🟢 green 1326; headline footprint intact (`peano_not_proves_goodstein = [propext, sorryAx, choice,
Quot.sound]`, 0 math axioms).** 1 code commit.

### Banked this lap (`RedZKDescent.lean`, axiom-clean `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`, green-gated)
- **`iCrit_halves_descend`** — for a valid critical `K^r` chain `dᵢ = zK s r ds`, the two critical-reduct
  halves `a,b = znth (zKseq (red dᵢ)) {0,1}` satisfy the per-half `õ`/`idg`/NF bounds below `dᵢ`
  (`ha`/`hb`/`hag`/`hbg`/`hNFa`/`hNFb`). **Key in-kernel fact:** the critical 5.1 reduct's `õ`-jump lives in
  the OUTER `K^{r-1}` rank-drop, NOT the individual halves — each half is a `K`-chain over
  `seqUpdate ds (redexI/J) (red·)` (i.e. `dᵢ`'s OWN premise sequence with the redex R/L premise swapped for
  its strictly-descending genuine reduct), so each premise-fold descends below `dᵢ` via `iotil_iCritAux_lt` /
  `idg_iCritAux_le` (`iotil`/`idg` ignore the half's reset conclusion/rank). Mirrors `iord_descent_red_zK_crit`'s
  redex extraction.
- **Wired into `iord_descent_red`'s splice branch** (`Crux2Blueprint.lean:595`): feeds the 6 bounds to
  `iord_descent_red_zK_chain_splice`, closing 6 of its 7 residual `sorry`s. **Only `hr'` remains.**

### ⚠️ THE `hr'` RESIDUAL — sharp in-kernel characterization (the splice degree-drop crux)
`hr' : max (irk (seqSucc (fstIdx (znth (zKseq (red dᵢ)) 0)))) r ≤ idg (zK s r ds)`. Established this lap:
`seqSucc (fstIdx (half0)) = chainAsucc dsᵢ (redexI dᵢ) = C`, the redex **principal** formula (the R-premise's
succedent). So `hr' = max (irk C) r ≤ idg(parent)`. The `r ≤ idg(parent)` half is `r_le_idg_zK`. The hard
half is `irk C ≤ idg(parent)`:
- `idg(parent) = max(r, iseqMaxIdg ds - 1)` (the `-1` is one cut-elim degree drop, baked into `idg_zK`).
- `irk C ≤ r'ᵢ` (dᵢ's rank) ONLY (`≤`, from the critical-pair finder `inference_critical_pair_rank`'s
  `hrank`), and `r'ᵢ ≤ idg(dᵢ) ≤ iseqMaxIdg ds`. So `irk C ≤ iseqMaxIdg ds` — **off by one** vs the needed
  `≤ iseqMaxIdg ds - 1`. The bound FAILS in the edge case `irk C = r'ᵢ = idg(dᵢ) = iseqMaxIdg ds` (dᵢ the
  strict-max-degree premise, its rank = its degree = the principal rank) unless `r ≥ iseqMaxIdg ds`.
- `red_zK_splice`'s rank `irk C` (principal `C = A_i`) is CORRECT — splicing `dⱼ`'s halves
  `d{0} ⊢ Θ→C`, `d{1} ⊢ C,Θ→D` flat into the parent makes the parent cut on `C`, so the parent rank must
  be `≥ irk C`. Not a stripping bug.
- **EDGE CASE where `hr'` genuinely FAILS** (in-kernel worked out): `irk C = r'ⱼ = idg(dⱼ) = iseqMaxIdg ds`
  with `dⱼ` the strict-max-degree premise and `r < iseqMaxIdg ds`. Then the splice rank `irk C = iseqMaxIdg ds`
  EXCEEDS `idg(parent) = max(r, iseqMaxIdg ds - 1)` — `iord` goes UP, descent fails. This is the cut-elim
  degree-drop pressure point: reducing the degree-DETERMINING critical premise `dⱼ` ought to drop the parent
  degree, but the spliced rank `irk C` doesn't fall below it. **Two genuine resolution paths (NEXT, hardest-first):**
  1. **Chain-rank invariant ruling out the edge case.** Show a valid chain has `irk(chainAsucc ds i) < idg`
     STRICT (or `r'ⱼ < iseqMaxIdg ds` when `dⱼ` is a chain premise) — i.e. the parent's degree strictly
     dominates any premise's cut-formula rank. Likely from a hereditary `idg`-vs-rank invariant carried by
     `zKValidF`/the embedding. If true, `irk C ≤ iseqMaxIdg ds - 1 ≤ idg(parent)` and `hr'` closes via
     `le_iseqMaxIdgAux` + `idg_zK`.
  2. **Measure refinement.** Adjust `iord`/the splice so the degree-determining premise's reduction is
     reflected (the splice rank should track the halves' reduced degrees, not `dⱼ`'s full pre-reduction rank).
  This shares the cut-rank/degree-drop bookkeeping with `redZKReady`'s motive (`Crux2Blueprint:340/493`).

### ⭐ ROOT CAUSE (lap-110, see `ANALYSIS-2026-06-25-lap110-iCritReductG-cut-formula-strip.md`)
`hr'` AND the critical-case soundness `ZDerivation_red_zK_crit` (`Crux2Blueprint:100`, `hCrk : irk C ≤
zKrank d - 1`) have a SHARED root cause: `iCritReductG`/`iRcritG` cut on the redex **PRINCIPAL** `C =
chainAsucc(redexI)` (`= Aᵢ`), but Buchholz Thm 3.4(a) (`buchholz-gentzen.txt:690/705/808`) cuts on the
**STRIPPED** subformula `A(d)` with `rk(A(d)) < r` STRICT (`= rk(Aᵢ) - 1`). `irk_cut_lt_rank_forall`/`_neg`
(`InternalZ:409/415`) supply the strict drop for the stripped formula. **Fix = redefine `iCritReductG`'s cut
formula to the stripped `A(d)`** (def `cutFormula d` by cases on `Aᵢ = ∀xF`/`¬A` from the redex, via
`substs1 k`/negand). The ordinal-DESCENT lemmas (`iord_descent_red_zK_crit`, `iCrit_halves_descend`) are
IMMUNE — `iotil`/`idg` read only the premise sequence, never `C` — so only `ZRegular`/`ZDerivation` (end-sequent
readers) and the splice rank `irk C` change. **`hr'` closes with ONLY the stripped rank bound (no inversion);
full `ZDerivation_red_zK_crit` additionally needs the ∀/¬-inversion `d{0}⊢Θ→A(d)`/`d{1}⊢A(d),Θ→D` (the deep
cut-elim, blueprint `wip/PathCInf.lean` `Zinfty.allInv`).** NEXT LAP: strip `iCritReductG`'s cut formula →
close `hr'`.

### Full open-sorry inventory (lap-110, headline-path; 3 paths each)
- **`hr'` splice rank** (`Crux2:608`): (1) strip `iCritReductG` cut formula [most promising, above]; (2)
  strict chain-rank-vs-degree invariant from `zKValidF`; (3) measure refinement.
- **chain-REPLACE IH** (`Crux2:594`): (1) `permIdx`/`isPermPrem` engine refinement skipping atom premises
  [lap-109 path 1]; (2) atom-free embedding invariant; (3) secondary lex descent measure.
- **atom/axAll/axNeg fixpoints** (`Crux2:568/610/612`): same atom-fixpoint wall as chain-REPLACE; (1) engine
  refinement; (2) prove ⊥-orbit never selects a normal-form leaf; (3) route atom-selected node to critical.
- **`ZDerivation_red_zK_crit`** (`Crux2:100`): (1) strip cut formula + ∀/¬-inversion [shared root cause];
  (2) port `Zinfty.allInv`/`andInv`/`orInv` from `wip/PathCInf.lean`; (3) abstract the inversions as a
  bundled hypothesis fed by the embedding.
- **`redZKReady` motive** (`Crux2:493`): (1) strengthen the `zDerivation_induction` motive to carry the
  7-field bundle hereditarily; (2) per-node orbit-invariant lemmas; (3) the localized `axNeg` residual
  (`Crux2:404`) needs Buchholz's genuine ¬-axiom cut.
- **`zKValidF_iIndReduct_of_zInd`** (`Crux2:81`): likely FALSE-as-stated (shadow reduct `[d1,d0]` doesn't
  thread to conclusion `F(t)`); (1) confirm vacuity/refute; (2) restate over the genuine eigensubst reduct;
  (3) drop if vestigial.
- **`false_of_ZDerivesEmpty`** (`Crux2:673`) / **`foundation_bot_to_Z_empty`** (`Crux2:661`): the terminal
  PRWO-internalization + Foundation⊥→Z embedding (need `prwoInstance`/Foundation coded-provability API).
- **`goodstein_implies_consistency`** (`Reduction:68`): both Rathjen girders (γ→PRWO + PRWO→Con).

## lap 109 — K-case branch-descent TRIO banked; the recursion wall CHARACTERIZED in-kernel
**Build 🟢 green 1326; headline footprint intact (`peano_not_proves_goodstein = [propext, sorryAx, choice,
Quot.sound]`).** 4 commits: critical sub-branch wired in place (`9e86a26`), replace descent (`8138b91`),
splice descent (`7371573`), baton (`3dc2cb4`).

### Banked this lap (all `RedZKDescent.lean`, axiom-clean, green-gated)
- **`iord_descent_red`'s K-case CRITICAL sub-branch — PROVEN IN PLACE.** Dispatches on the `permIdx`
  sentinel; critical branch fires `iord_descent_red_zK_crit` with `zKValid` = `zKValidF` (from `ZDerivation`)
  + `zKCritical_of_not_permIdx_lt`. **Resolved lap-108's "wire zKValid into ZPhi" worry — criticality is FREE
  from the branch dispatch.**
- **`iord_descent_red_zK_replace_eq`** (5.2.2) — reduces to premise IH `iRedDescent (red dᵢ) dᵢ` via
  `iotil_zK_lt_replace` + `idg_zK_le_replace` + `iord_descent_le`.
- **`iord_descent_red_zK_splice_eq`** (5.2.1) — reduces to the two halves' bounds + rank bound `r'≤dg(parent)`
  via the banked rank-general `iord_descent_seqInsert'`.

### K-branch dispatch — three reducible sub-cases CLOSED in place (lap-109 late)
`iord_descent_red`'s non-critical K-branch now dispatches on the selected premise's tag. CLOSED (banked,
non-recursive `iRedDescent` bundles → `iord_descent_red_zK_replace_eq`): **I¬** (`iRedDescent_zIneg`),
**Ind** (`iRedDescent_zInd`), **I∀** (`iRedDescent_red_zIall`, NEW — eigensubst-invariant, no regularity).
**REMAINING sub-sorries (4):** `atom`/`axAll`/`axNeg` (the FIXPOINT defect — `red dᵢ = dᵢ`, no descent) and
`chain` (the recursive core). The critical branch + I-rule/Ind branches are DONE.

### ⚠️ THE RECURSION WALL — kernel-confirmed obstruction (the gating crux for the `chain` sub-case)
Wiring the two `_eq` lemmas for the `chain` sub-case needs `iord_descent_red` restructured as a strong
induction (mirror `redSoundGen`) to supply the premise IH `iRedDescent (red dᵢ) dᵢ`. **The IH's STRICT `otil_lt` requires the
selected premise `dᵢ = znth ds (permIdx)` to be REDUCIBLE.** Kernel facts established this lap:
- `iperm (isymLk k A) q ↔ inAnt A (seqAnt q)` (`iperm_isymLk_iff`) — axiom leaves CAN be permissible.
- `iperm isymRep q` is ALWAYS true (`iperm_isymRep`) — every Rep premise is permissible ⟹ `permIdx = 0` when
  premise 0 is Rep.
- Cor 2.1 (lap-90, `ANALYSIS-…-lap90`): on the ⊥-orbit (`Γ=∅, C=⊥`) the selected premise is ALWAYS Rep
  (axioms need `A∈Γ=∅`, impossible; I-rules' succedent ≠ ⊥). So NO axiom-leaf selection AT THE TOP.
- **BUT Rep = {atom(0), Ind(3), chain(4)}, and `red(atom) = atom` (atoms are normal forms ⟹ NO strict
  `iord` descent).** If a ⊥-chain's selected (first permissible) premise is an ATOM, the replace reduct
  equals the original ⟹ `iord_descent_red` FIXPOINTS, descent FAILS. The recursion also dives OFF the
  ⊥-orbit (5.2.2 recurses on the Rep chain `dᵢ`, not a ⊥-derivation), where axiom-leaf selection returns.

**Three resolution paths (next lap, hardest-first):**
1. **Prove selected premise on the ⊥-orbit is never a bare ATOM (refine Cor 2.1).** An atom `dᵢ=zAtom sᵢ`
   has `Cᵢ ∈ Γᵢ` (`zDerivation_zAtom_inv`). PARTIAL kernel result worked out this lap: an atom at position
   **0** of a ⊥-chain is IMPOSSIBLE — threading forces `Γ₀ ⊆ seqAnt s = ∅` (no prior premise to thread to),
   but the atom needs `C₀ ∈ Γ₀`. **SUBTLETY (blocks the naive claim):** an atom at i>0 is NOT forbidden by
   threading alone — an earlier I-rule premise i'<i with `chainAsucc ds i' = Cᵢ` supplies the membership, and
   since permissibility = Rep-only (I-rules non-permissible), that atom can still be the FIRST permissible (=
   selected) premise. So path 1 needs MORE than threading: the real fix is that **the `isymRep` tag conflates
   atoms (normal forms) with Ind/chains (reducible)** — `iperm isymRep` always-true wrongly admits atoms as
   "permissible". The genuine engine refinement: make `permIdx`/`isPermPrem` SKIP atom premises (or route an
   atom-selected node to critical), so the selected premise is always Ind/chain (reducible). This is a real
   `red`/`isPermPrem` change — verify it stays faithful to Buchholz (atoms are cut-free, never the reduction
   site). **MOST PROMISING but needs an engine tweak, not just a lemma.**
2. **Secondary descent measure.** Augment `iord` with a lexicographic component (e.g. derivation size / cut
   count) that strictly drops even on an atom-fixpoint replace step, so the orbit measure descends regardless.
3. **Pivot to the Σ₁-Fixpoint ARITHMETIZATION of the ω-rule cut-elim** (lap-108 escalation note) if 1+2 both
   fail — the finitary engine is then genuinely dead. Math doubly-proven (Bryce-Goré Coq + axiom-clean META
   `Zinfty.lean`).

### Other self-contained crux-2 sorries (any can be attacked independently of the wall)
- `zKValidF_iIndReduct_of_zInd` (`Crux2Blueprint:79`) — Ind-reduct chain validity; mirror
  `zKValidF_iCritReductSeq` (`InternalZ:3095`) but for the `iIndReductSeq` shape (need
  `isChainInf_iIndReductSeq` + per-premise wff). Self-contained, ~1 lap.
- `redZKReady` motive (`Crux2Blueprint:340/493`) — the 7-field orbit invariant carried hereditarily; SHARED
  wall with the descent recursion.
- `axNeg` (`ZDerivation_red_zK_nonRep`, `Crux2Blueprint:404`) — ¬-axiom premise reduct is a succedent
  REPLACEMENT (`tpReduce(tp zAxNeg) s 0 = seqSetSucc s p`, `Γ→p`); needs Buchholz's genuine ¬-axiom cut.
- `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` (`Crux2Blueprint:619`) — internalize `n↦iord(red^[n] z)` as a Σ₁ graph + apply the
  internal PRWO(ε₀) instance (`prwoInstance`, `wip/GentzenCon`). Consumes the proven `iord_red_iterate_descends`.

## lap 108 — `iord_descent_red` NARROWED to the K/cut case + the two-engine map corrected
**Build 🟢 green 1325; `src/` headline footprint intact.** Concrete advance + a correction to the lap-107
diagnosis (which conflated two distinct `red`s):

- **`iord_descent_red` (`Crux2Blueprint.lean`) — Ind branch PROVEN in place.** A `∅→⊥` derivation has top
  tag 3 (Ind) or 4 (K), `zTag_Ind_or_K_of_ZDerivesEmpty`. The Ind branch now closes via the banked
  `iord_descent_red_zInd`; the residual `sorry` is isolated to exactly the **K/cut case** (tag 4). This is
  the headline-WIRED finitary engine (`InternalZ`, tags 0-6), the real crux-2 obligation.

- **K-case CRITICAL branch descent BANKED (`src/GoodsteinPA/RedZKDescent.lean`, NEW, sorry-free, axiom-clean
  `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`, green-gated 1326).** `iord_descent_red_zK_crit`: for a critical
  (`¬ permIdx < lh ds`) valid `K^r` chain, `icmp (iord (red (zK s r ds))) (iord (zK s r ds)) = 0`. Ports the
  banked `iord_descent_iR2_zK_of_valid` (`iR2`-ρ) to the genuine `red`-ρ via two new bundle lemmas
  (`iRedDescent_zAxReduct_red_of_tp_isymR/_isymLk`) + `iord_iRcritG_eq_iRcrit` (genuine reduct shares `iord`
  with the ordinal-shadow). The I∀ redex premise's eigensubst (`red = zsubst d0 a 0`) preserves `iotil`/`idg`
  (`iotil_zsubst`/`idg_zsubst`) so the bundle transfers, costing only the regularity `maxEigen d0 < a`
  (`maxEigen_lt_of_regular_zIall`, hence the `hreg` hypothesis). **NOT yet wired into `iord_descent_red`'s
  K-case — two gaps remain:** (a) the **non-critical splice/replace branch descents** (`red_zK_splice`/`_rep`,
  unbanked — the genuine open ordinal core); (b) **`zKValid` availability from the ∅→⊥ orbit** — the bare
  `ZDerivation` `zK` disjunct does NOT carry `zKValid` (`InternalZ.lean:7517`), so even the critical branch
  can't fire from `ZDerivesEmptyR` alone yet (the "wire `zKValid` into `ZPhi`" phase, `InternalZ.lean:7519`).

- **TWO distinct `red`s (lap-107 docs conflated them — corrected here):**
  1. **`src/InternalZ.lean` finitary engine `red` (tags 0-6)** — the HEADLINE-WIRED one
     (`Crux2Blueprint.iord_descent_red`/`redSoundGen`/`false_of_ZDerivesEmpty`/`ZDerivesEmptyR`). Open
     pieces: (a) `iord_descent_red` K/cut case — `red (zK s r ds) = iRK …` dispatches 3 Buchholz branches
     (5.1 critical `iRcritG`, 5.2.1 splice, 5.2.2 replace); only the CRITICAL descent is banked
     (`iord_descent_iR2_zK_of_valid`, for the `iR2`-ρ — needs re-pointing to `red`-ρ); splice/replace descents
     are unbanked. (b) `redSoundGen` K-case needs the `redZKReady` "spine" motive (lap-101 flagged it shaky:
     ∅→⊥ chain premises have growing antecedents ⟹ Cor 2.1 may not reapply down the spine) + the `axNeg`
     sub-residual (`ZDerivation_red_zK_nonRep` tag-6 `sorry`, Buchholz ¬-axiom cut). (c) `foundation_bot_to_Z_empty`
     embedding (`Crux2Blueprint:587`).
  2. **`wip/PathCOmega.lean` prototype `red` (tags 7-10, ω-rule)** — the lap-104 STALL (`red_redAllEx_eq`,
     `sord_red_iterate_stalls_AllEx`) is about THIS one, NOT the finitary engine. It is an external inductive
     (non-load-bearing, lap-107 Finding 2), so it cannot reach the headline regardless.

- **Strategic state (honest).** crux-2 is a genuine multi-month milestone with deep open walls on BOTH the
  finitary engine (K-descent splice/replace + the shaky `redZKReady` spine + axNeg) and the ω-rule prototype
  (non-load-bearing + stall). The mathematically-clean route is the ω-rule (Bryce-Goré + the repo's own
  axiom-clean META `Zinfty.lean`), but it needs Σ₁ ARITHMETIZATION (a Fixpoint predicate over coded
  ω-derivations — the node shapes `zAllOmega s d0 a α` already code the ω-family finitely via `zsubst d0 a t`;
  the deferred work is making the validity predicate a `PR.Blueprint`/`Construction` Fixpoint, not an external
  inductive). **NEXT (hardest-first):** either (A) re-point `iord_descent_iR2_zK_of_valid` to the `red`-ρ and
  bank the splice/replace branch descents to finish `iord_descent_red`'s K case on the finitary engine; or
  (B) start the Σ₁-Fixpoint arithmetization of the ω-rule cut-elimination. (A) is closer to the wired
  headline; (B) is mathematically cleaner. Lean toward (A) first (the finitary engine is what's wired and the
  K-descent is concrete), escalating to (B) if the `redZKReady` spine proves genuinely broken (settle it
  in-kernel like lap-104 settled the prototype stall — don't leave it "shaky" indefinitely).

---

## lap 107 — ⭐⭐⭐ FRESH-MIND REVIEW: the external-inductive prototype track is a DEAD END (kernel-verified); pivot to the Σ₁ engine `red` redesign

**Two in-kernel findings this lap force a direction change (build 🟢 green 1325; `src/` untouched).**

**Finding 1 — `ZInf.allInv` is VACUOUS (verified).** The lap-106 ∀-inversion lemma
(`ZInf Γ → inAnt (^∀φ) Γ → ZInf (seqCons Γ φ(t))`) is provable by a SINGLE weakening
(`ZInf.weaken_top d.seq d`), using neither `ht` nor the membership hypothesis — confirmed by replacing the
whole `induction` and elaborating (`wip/PathCInf.lean`, now renamed `ZInf.allInv_vacuous` with the one-liner
proof + the finding in its docstring). Root cause: the META `Zinfty.allInvAux` content is (1) **ordinal
preservation** (`Provable (o d) c …`) and (2) **erasure** of `^∀φ` (`Γ.erase (∀⁰χ)`); `ZInf : V → Prop`
has **no ordinal index** and the statement **keeps `^∀φ`**, so the conclusion is a mere weakening of `Γ`.
⟹ the lap-106 "principal case proven" + 6 commuting `sorry`s + the planned `permCongr` perf fix were all
work on a content-free lemma. **STOP the `permCongr` fix.**

**Finding 2 — external inductives are NON-LOAD-BEARING for the headline.** `ZInf`/`ZcOK`/`ZcDer` are all
external Lean `inductive … : V → Prop` (PathCOmega.lean:701-702 says so explicitly: "PROTOTYPE the
cut-elimination math … the Σ₁ port … is the deferred final brick"). But the headline needs `IΣ₁ ⊢ Con(PA)`,
i.e. the ε₀-descent must hold in EVERY `V ⊧ IΣ₁`, including non-standard models where the coded ⊥-proof `z`
is **non-standard** — and no external (well-founded) inductive tree exists for a non-standard `z`, so the
embedding `foundation_bot_to_Z_empty` (`Crux2Blueprint.lean:576`) is **unprovable** for such `z`. The
prototypes can guide the inversion combinatorics but can never be wired in. The load-bearing carrier is the
**Σ₁ CODE engine** `red`/`iord` (`InternalZ.lean`), which is already arithmetized and total on all codes
(standard + non-standard) — that's why `iord_red_iterate_descends` builds the ℕ-indexed descent.

**The real obstruction (re-confirmed, lap-104).** Engine `red d = znth (redTable d) d` steps via
`iRNextG d s` (`InternalZ.lean:6915`), which dispatches **only on the conclusion's top `zTag`**
(1→eigensubst, 2→peel, 3→`iRInd`, 4→`iRK`, else→identity). After one K/cut reduction the reduct's top is no
longer a cut, so `red` becomes identity → the orbit STALLS (lap-104: `red_redAllEx_eq`,
`sord_red_iterate_stalls_AllEx`). Hence `iord_descent_red` (`Crux2Blueprint.lean:533`) is **unprovable for
the current `red`**, and it is the true crux of crux-2.

**⏭ NEXT (hardest-first) — the engine `red` redesign (Gentzen's reduction on codes):**
1. **Redesign `red`/`iRNextG` to locate the relevant redex anywhere in the derivation code, not just the top
   node.** For an empty-sequent (∅→⊥) derivation the endsequent has no logical content, so the lowest
   inference must be a cut; reduce THAT cut and the conclusion stays ∅→⊥ with a strictly smaller `iord`.
   This is a Σ₁ tree-search (`redTable`-style) for the lowest/topmost cut + a local key-reduction. The
   prototype inversion cases (which premise to select at the witness `t`, how `#`/`iotower` ordinals combine)
   are the GUIDE — port them onto codes.
2. **Prove `iord_descent_red`** (the K/cut case; the Ind case `iord_descent_red_zInd` is already done) for
   the redesigned `red`: `icmp (iord (red d)) (iord d) = 0` for a regular ∅→⊥ orbit `d`.
3. **`false_of_ZDerivesEmpty`** (`Crux2Blueprint.lean:588`): the ℕ-indexed `iord`-descent (already assembled,
   `iord_red_iterate_descends`) contradicts `PRWO(ε₀)`. Wire crux-1 PRWO + the embedding.
4. Discharge the remaining `Crux2Blueprint` validity `sorry`s (78/95/196/369/455) + `foundation_bot_to_Z_empty`
   (576), then wire crux-1 ∘ crux-2 → `Reduction.goodstein_implies_consistency` → headline (ONLY when
   `#print axioms` clean).

**`wip/PathCInf.lean` + the `ZcDer`/`ZcOK` prototypes stay as a combinatorial sketch — do NOT invest more in
them; they cannot reach the headline.** Keep `InternalZ`/`Crux2Blueprint` (the engine) green in `src/`.

---

## lap 106 — ✅ prerequisite 1 (conclusion-tracking) STARTED: `ZcDer` + conclusion-faithful principal ∀-inversion
**Brick 5o (`wip/PathCOmega.lean`, all axiom-clean `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`; `lake build GoodsteinPA`
green 1325; `src/` untouched).** Closes lap-105's NEXT prerequisite (1, "conclusion-tracking on the datatype"):
- `fstIdx_zAllOmega`/`fstIdx_zExOmega` — the missing Path-C conclusion projections.
- `inductive ZcDer : V → Prop` — `ZcOK` refined so the ω-∀ node carries its conclusion data (succedent
  `^∀ p`, premise-`t` derives `Γ⟹p(t)` = `seqSetSucc s (substs1 t p)`). Strictly positive ⟹ Lean gives a
  STRUCTURAL recursor incl. an IH over the infinitary ω-premise family — the recursion vehicle for the
  commuting inversion at the PROTOTYPE level (the deferred Σ₁/PRWO transfinite induction is only for the
  arithmetized layer; the inductive itself recurses structurally).
- `ZcDer.toZcOK` — forgetful map (structural induction), so EVERY lap-105 ordinal brick applies to a
  `ZcDer` orbit.
- `zcDer_iff`/`ZcPhiD` — the inversion vehicle (cf. `zcOK_iff`).
- `zcDer_allOmega_inv` — first end-sequent recovery on the Path-C layer (matrix `p`, instance conclusions).
- `zcDer_iord_descent_allOmega` — the principal ∀-inversion step, now CONCLUSION-faithful (new over
  lap-105's `zcOK_iord_descent_zAllOmega`): premise derives `Γ⟹p(t)`, `ZcDer`-preserved, `iord ≺ α`.
- `zIall_realizes_ZcDer` — the embedding's I∀ image realizes a conclusion-tracking ω-∀ `ZcDer` node (so
  `ZcDer` is inhabited by real derivations, not an abstract prototype).

**Calculus pinned this lap (Buchholz Z∞, `scratchpad/buchholz-gentzen.txt:924-972`):** sequents `Γ→C`
(single succedent); inference symbols `R_A` (intro on RIGHT/succedent), `Lk_A` (intro on LEFT/antecedent),
`Cut_D`. Cut on `D`: premise0 = `Γ,D→C` (`Cut_D(Π,0)=Π.D`, D in antecedent), premise1 = `Γ→D`
(`Cut_D(Π,1)=D,Π`). So Path-C `zCutOmega s α dL dR C`: conclusion `s`, cut formula `C`, dL/dR derive the
two Cut premises — NOT the loose "C/¬C" of earlier handoffs. Pin this before extending conclusion-tracking
to ex/cut.

**⏭ NEXT (hardest-first):**
0. **`ZInf.allInv` commuting cases — the bookkeeping `sorry`s (`wip/PathCInf.lean`).** The ∀-inversion
   recursion STRUCTURE + the principal `allω` selection + atomic base cases (`axL`/`verumR`) are PROVEN.
   The commuting cases (`weak`/`andI`/`orI`/`exI`/`cut`/`allω`-side) carry a disclosed `sorry`: their
   `seqCons`-tower permutation/membership bookkeeping triggers pathological HFS `whnf` under `induction`
   (timeout even at 1.6M heartbeats). **Suspected cause:** `seqCons_comm`/`weaken_*` take the consed
   formulas IMPLICITLY, so Lean infers them by unifying `seqCons (seqCons Γ A) B` against the premise type
   — forcing `lh`/`insert` whnf. **Fix (next lap):** (a) give the helpers EXPLICIT formula args (no
   inference), and/or (b) a single `ZInf.permCongr : Seq Δ → (∀ A, inAnt A Γ ↔ inAnt A Δ) → ZInf Γ → ZInf Δ`
   proven ONCE standalone (helpers compile fast OUTSIDE `induction`), each commuting case = one `permCongr`
   with a `tauto`-closed membership `↔`. The math is the verbatim `Zinfty.allInvAux` port; only term-mode
   cost is open. Then: port `andInvAux`/`orInvAux`, then `cutElimStep`, then bridge `ZInf`-height ↔ engine
   `iord` for the PRWO descent, then wire to `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` (`Crux2Blueprint.lean:588`).
1. **Extend conclusion-tracking to the ∃ and cut nodes** (shapes pinned above) so the commuting ∀-inversion
   is statable on a cut/∃ last rule. Add the conclusion conjuncts to `ZcDer.ex`/`ZcDer.cut`.
2. **The commuting ∀-inversion recursion** over `ZcDer` (structural — the recursor handles the ω-family),
   porting `Zinfty.allInvAux`'s case structure (ω-∀ principal = `zcDer_iord_descent_allOmega` banked).
   BLOCKER: `ZcDer.leaf` wraps an arbitrary engine `ZDerivation`, so a leaf deriving `Γ⟹^∀ p` still needs
   ENGINE-level ∀-inversion — motivates expanding the datatype with explicit ∧/∨/atom constructors (leaves
   become atomic). NEXT_STEPS PRIORITY-1 item 1 ("ADD ∧/∨ intro + atom-axiom") is the same call.

## lap 105 — ✅ the cut-node ORDINAL bookkeeping is CLOSED; ⏭ the structural `hinv` (inversion) is the bottleneck
**See `HANDOFF-2026-06-25-lap105.md`, STATUS lap-105 box.** Build green 1325; `src/` untouched (headline 0
math axioms). This lap CLOSED the lap-104 ordinal obstruction (the `imax`-can't-do-operator-control finding):
the textbook cut ordinal `max(o(dL),o(dR))+1` (`inc (imax …)`, brick 5e) gives operator-control (no
positivity — handles axiom leaves) AND descent against an arbitrary parent (no additive-principality),
UNIFORMLY for both ω-nodes (∀ brick 5e, induction 5g) + the canonical cut constructor `zcOK_cutS`/`_leaf`
(brick 5h) + leaf-NF auto-discharge (5f). All axiom-clean in `wip/PathCOmega.lean`.

**⏭ THE REMAINING BOTTLENECK (next lap, hardest-first) — the STRUCTURAL `hinv`, two genuinely-deep pieces:**
1. **Conclusion-tracking on the datatype.** `ZcOK` currently tracks only ordinal operator-control, NOT the
   conclusion sequent each node derives. Inversion ("from a derivation of `Γ, ∀x F` extract one of `Γ, F(t)`")
   is INEXPRESSIBLE without it. Enrich `ZcOK` (or a paired predicate) so each node carries/constrains its
   conclusion `fstIdx d`. This is the prerequisite for both inversion AND "∅→⊥ has no cut-free proof" (the
   fact that forces `red` to run forever).
2. **General ∀/∧/∨-inversion `redInv*`.** The recursion that RE-PRINCIPALIZES a reduct premise that is NOT
   literally an ω-node (the lap-104 stall: after the ∀/∃ reduction the new left premise `zsubst d0 a t` is an
   engine leaf, tag ≤ 6, so `red` can't fire again). `Zinfty.allInvAux`/`andInvAux`/`orInvAux`
   (`src/Zinfty.lean`) are the axiom-clean META templates to port. Inversion preserves the stored ordinal
   (`≼`), so it composes with the `max+1` descent.

**⭐ Strategic lead (handoff "Strategic finding"):** the engine `iord d = iotower (iotil d) (idg d)` is ALREADY
the `ω_{rank}^{õ}` tower, and `iord_descent_cut` (`InternalZ.lean:2596`) already proves a higher-rank cut node
strictly dominates its lower-rank premises (the rank-mixing the `max+1`/`#` measures cannot do). For the
COMPOUND-cut commuting reductions, relate the cut node's stored ordinal to `iord` and reuse `iord_descent_cut`
rather than re-deriving the tower.

## lap 104 — ⚠ ENDGAME CORRECTION: the naive `red_iterate_descends` `hinv` is unsatisfiable (in-kernel cert)
**See `HANDOFF-2026-06-25-lap104.md`, STATUS lap-104 box, `NEXT_STEPS.md`.** Build green 1325; `src/`
untouched (headline 0 math axioms). Lap 103 packaged crux-2 as `red_iterate_descends {P} (hinv) (hdrop) (hz)`
and framed `hinv` (`∀ w, P w → P (red w)`) as "tractable via premise selection". **This lap proved that
framing false in-kernel** (4 new axiom-clean lemmas in `wip/PathCOmega.lean`):

- `zTag_ne_seven_of_ZDerivation` — every engine `ZDerivation` has tag ∈ {0..6}, never the stored-ω-∀ tag 7.
- `red_redAllEx_eq` — given the ∀-node base premise `d0` is a `ZDerivation`, the ∀/∃-cut reduct `redAllEx`
  is a `red`-FIXPOINT: its new left premise `zsubst d0 a t` has tag `= zTag d0 ≠ 7` (`zTag_zsubst`), so the
  `(9,7,10)` dispatch fails and `red` is the identity.
- `sord_red_iterate_stalls_AllEx` — on a concrete ∀/∃-cut node, `red` fires once then stalls forever, so
  `sord (red^[n+2] w) = sord (red^[n+1] w)`: the stored ordinal is CONSTANT from step 1 — no infinite descent.
- `naive_dispatch_P_not_red_closed` — ANY `P` implying the `(9,7,10)` dispatch shape fails `hinv` on the
  reduct.

**Root cause (the genuine `hinv` content).** Reducing a cut on `∀x F` produces a smaller cut on `F(t)` whose
premises (`zsubst d0 a t` ⊢ `Γ→F(t)`, `zExPrem dR` ⊢ `Γ→¬F(t)`) need NOT be principal nodes for `F(t)`. To
keep the orbit reducible, `red` must RE-PRINCIPALIZE them — i.e. apply Schütte/Tait **inversion** operators
(`redInv∀`/`redInv∧`/`redInv∨`: from any derivation of `Γ, A` extract a derivation of the immediate
subformula instance, stored ordinal `≼`). Inversion is a recursion over the derivation ⟹ it needs the
genuine **Path-C derivation predicate** (datatype). So `hinv` = the Hauptsatz (inversion + reduction), the
irreducible deep content of crux-2. The lap-103 bricks (nodes/`sord`/per-step drops) stay valid; the endgame
*shape* changes. **CORRECTED NEXT (hardest-first): build the `zcOK` datatype, then inversion, then `red`/`hinv`
— NOT more `hdrop` cut-shape cases (easy leaves on an unsatisfiable `hinv`).** See `NEXT_STEPS.md` PRIORITY 1
(updated lap 104).

**Brick 5 STARTED this lap (axiom-clean, `wip/PathCOmega.lean`).** The datatype as a clean Lean
`inductive ZcOK : V → Prop` (constructors: `leaf` wrapping an engine `ZDerivation`, `omegaAll` [INFINITARY
premise family, strictly positive], `ex`, `cut`; each carries Buchholz operator-control `sord ≺ α`). The
inductive-over-`V` `cases` dependent-elim wall is handled exactly as the engine does: `zcOK_iff` (the
`ZcPhi`-disjunction recursion equation, proved by `cases` on a FREE variable) is the inversion vehicle.
Landed `zcOK_cut_inv` / `zcOK_omegaAll_inv` / `zcOK_ex_inv` (node inversions, `zTag`-discriminated) +
`zTag_ne_nine/ten_of_ZDerivation`. This is the prototype on which inversion (`redInv∀`/…) + `red` + `hinv`
get developed; the Σ₁-`Fixpoint` port (so the descent is V-internal for PRWO) is the deferred final brick.
**Brick 5b (axiom-clean):** principal ∀/∃-cut `hinv`, split clean — `zcOK_redAllEx_premises` (the
STRUCTURAL closure: the reduct's two premises `zsubst d0 a tE` / `dE` are `ZcOK`, the genuine soundness
content) + `zcOK_redAllEx_of_ctrl` (full closure GIVEN the reduct's ordinal control). **⚠ 2nd lap-104
finding (in-kernel): the lap-103 `imax` stored-ordinal is INSUFFICIENT for the cut node.** The `cut`
constructor needs `sord premise ≺ stored`, but the reduct stores `imax (sord dL') (sord dR')` and the
max-achieving premise EQUALS `imax` (never `≺`, `icmp` irreflexive). `imax` worked for the parent-cut
*descent* (`sord_redAllEx_lt`) but NOT for the reduct's own *operator-control*. The genuine fix is Gentzen's
RANK-AWARE ordinal assignment (`o(cut) = ω^{rank} ⊕ …`, strictly above premises AND ≺ parent, carrying the
single-step descent) — the deep Gentzen-Hauptsatz content, now isolated to the ORDINAL assignment alone.

**NEXT (two fronts):** (a) the ∀-inversion operator `redInv∀ : V → V → V` + `ZcOK d → ZcOK (redInv∀ d t)`
(the recursion that re-principalizes the GENERAL — non-ω-∀-node — left premise; principal case =
`zcOK_omegaAll_inv`); (b) the rank-aware `sord` (replace `imax`) so the cut node's operator-control + the
single-step descent hold together (`zcOK_redAllEx_of_ctrl`'s `hLctrl`/`hRctrl` + `sord_redAllEx_lt`).

## lap 102 — Probe 2 settled the fork → Path C (stored ordinals); brick 1 landed
**See `HANDOFF-2026-06-25-lap102.md`, `NEXT_STEPS.md` PRIORITY 1.** The crux-2 sub-route fork is resolved
in favour of **Path C** (ω-rule, Buchholz operator-controlled derivations with STORED ordinals). Path X
(finitary `redZKReady`) is disfavoured AND likely broken (hereditary-Rep fails down a nested-chain spine).
Probe 2 lemmas in `wip/InternalZomega.lean` (axiom-clean): `iotil_zK_iIndReduct(_strictMono)`,
`ocOadd_coeff_strictMono`.

**Path-C brick list (`wip/PathCOmega.lean`):**
- **Brick 1 — DONE, FULL (axiom-clean).** `zAllOmega`/`zAllOmegaValid`(+`Full`) — the stored-ordinal ω-∀-node
  + complete validity (premise family valid + conclusion-tracked `Γ→F(t)` + ordinal ≺ stored `α`).
  `zIall_realizes_zAllOmegaValid(Full)` (a regular finitary `zIall` realizes ALL THREE, stored ordinal = the
  node's own `iord`); `zAllOmega_concl` (conclusion computed, not threaded); `zAllOmega_cut_valid`/`_descends`
  (the ∀-cut invariant).
- **Brick 2 (NEXT) — `cutElimStep`** (single rank drop, all node shapes; `Zinfty.cutElimStep`/
  `cutElimPrincipal` template; ∀-cut case = brick 1, others = `cutReduce*` for ∧/∨/atom).
- **Brick 3 — the induction ω-node.** KERNEL DONE (axiom-clean): `indOmegaStoredOrd` (the stored limit
  ordinal `ω_{dg}(ω^{õd1+1} # ω^{õd0})`) + `iord_iIndReduct_lt_storedBound` (it dominates every finite
  unfolding's `iord`, uniformly in `k` — the side-condition the computed `iord` can't compute, discharged).
  Remaining: package as node + validity (premise `ZDerivation`s via `znth_iIndReductSeq_ZDerivation`,
  conclusion-tracking `F(k)`, Σ₁ side-condition), mirroring `zAllOmega`/`zAllOmegaValid`.
- **Brick 4 — `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` (Path C)**: SKELETON DONE (`stored_ord_iterate_descends`).
  **Endgame design clarified:** Path C uses Buchholz's single-step ordinal-DROPPING `red` (Def 3.2), NOT
  Zinfty's rank-by-rank `cutElimStep` (which raises the ordinal; that's the META proof). Iterating `red`
  on ∅→⊥ = infinite ε₀-descent ⟹ contradicts PRWO(ε₀) (crux-1), exactly the existing finitary formulation
  (`Crux2Blueprint.iord_red_iterate_descends`). Bricks 1/3 ARE the per-node drops feeding it. Remaining:
  `red` on the datatype + wire to `gentzen_descent_of_inconsistent`.
- **Σ₁-definability** of `zAllOmega`/`zAllOmegaValid` (bookkeeping; `⟪…⟫`/`icmp`/`iord` are `𝚺₁`/`𝚫₁`).
- **Cut-tree carrier for the induction node** — brick 3's ordinal bound uses the FINITARY `iIndReductSeq`
  carrier (re-imports the K-chain). The ordinal fact is path-portable (cut-trees use the same `#`-natural
  sum), but the final Path-C induction node's premise must be a cut-TREE deriving `F(k)`, not the chain.
  Build once the cut-node datatype (brick 2) exists.

## Reflection — 2026-06-25 (lap 101 DEEP REFLECTION)
**See `REFLECTION-2026-06-25-lap101.md` + `NEXT_STEPS.md` (the corrected priority list).** Kernel
re-verified in-kernel: headline `[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms),
`peano_not_proves_consistency` clean, faithfulness anchor clean, statement re-audited vs paper — no drift.

**Direction call.** Destination KEEP (`𝗣𝗔 ⊬ Goodstein`, axiom-free, Rathjen/Gentzen). crux-2 target KEEP
(`redSound`). **Sub-route fork REOPENED.** The lap-92 reflection recommended the ω-rule pivot (Path C) with
a de-risk spike to run FIRST; lap-95 overruled to Path X (finitary) **without running the spike** (it was
never written — `find` confirms). Laps 95–100 made real mechanical progress (the `iRK` gate, the
I∀/I¬/axAll non-Rep replace cases) but the wall *relocated* (eigensubst O2 → the `redZKReady`
hereditary-all-Rep motive), exactly the conclusion-tracking the ω-rule retires for free. And the motive's
hard core is shaky: ∅→⊥ chain premises have growing antecedents `{A₀..A_{i-1}}→Dᵢ`, so Cor 2.1 does NOT
reapply down the selected-premise spine ⟹ "hereditary all-Rep" may not hold as stated.

**KEEP:** crux-2 = `redSound` target; the ordinal engine + `zsubst` + `Zinfty` meta template as reusable
assets; `#print axioms`-gated bare-`sorry` headline discipline.
**STOP:** sinking laps into the `redZKReady` motive / axNeg ¬-cut until the spike's verdict — these are
exactly what the ω-rule would retire.
**HIGHEST-VALUE NEXT:** the skipped de-risk spike `wip/InternalZomega.lean` — internal ω-rule ∀-node
(premise family via `zsubst h x (numeral n)`) + substitution-free critical-cut reduct + `iord` assignment
probe. Elaborates clean → PIVOT to Path C (retires the whole finitary obligation list at once; math
doubly-proven by Bryce–Goré + the repo's own axiom-clean meta `Zinfty.lean`). Walls on Σ₁-arithmetization
→ commit to Path X with evidence. Either way the fork stops being re-litigated each reflection lap. Path X
infra stays in `src/` (green, fallback). **Full spike spec + decision rule: `NEXT_STEPS.md` PRIORITY 1.**

## 📍 Lap 100 — 3/4 non-Rep replace capstones ASSEMBLED + wiring piece B banked
**Build 🟢 1325. Headline `[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms).** This lap banked,
all axiom-clean `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`:
- `ZDerivation_zK_replace_zIneg_of` (Crux2Blueprint) — **I¬ non-Rep replace fully assembled** modulo orbit
  invariants. Uses `ZDerivation_iCritReplaceReduce_general` (membership isChainInf, antecedent GROWS by `p`).
  Un-discharged inputs: `hd0ant : seqAnt (fstIdx d0) = seqCons (seqAnt sᵢ) p` (faithful premise-antecedent,
  the I¬ analogue of I∀'s O3 freshness — `zInegWff` pins only `p ∈ antecedent`), `hSeqs`/`hSeqsi` (Seq-wff),
  `hthread`/`hrank`.
- `ZDerivation_zK_replace_zAxAll_of` (Crux2Blueprint) — **axAll non-Rep replace fully assembled** (cleanest;
  NO threading needed — pure antecedent monotonicity via `ZDerivation_zK_seqAddAnt`). Un-discharged:
  `hSeqs` + `hAwff : IsUFormula (substs1 (numeral k) p)`.
- `thread_rank_restrict_of_le` (InternalZ, after `permIdx_le_of_isPermPrem`) — **wiring piece B**: restrict
  parent threading/rank up-to-`j₀` down to `i ≤ j₀`. Trivial `le_trans`, exactly the capstones' `hthread`/`hrank`.

**STATUS of the four non-Rep cases:** I∀ ✅ (lap 99 `_zIall_of`), I¬ ✅, axAll ✅, **axNeg ❌ OPEN (Path C)**.

### ⚠ axNeg is GENUINELY harder — NOT a simple succedent-replacement (lap-100 finding)
The axNeg reduct (5.2.2, `tp(d):=tp(dᵢ)`) gives conclusion `Γ→p` (`seqSetSucc s p`). But the reduct premise
`red dᵢ = dᵢ` keeps succedent `D = seqSucc sᵢ ≠ p`. So unlike I∀/I¬ (where the reduced premise's succedent
MATCHES the new conclusion succedent, feeding `isChainInf_…_reduceR`'s `hsucc_v`), **for axNeg no premise has
succedent `p`** — the naive `isChainInf (seqSetSucc s p) r ds` is FALSE (`chainAsucc ds j₀' = p` has no
witness). Buchholz handles `¬A` via the CRITICAL pair (5.1: an L⁰_{¬A} redex pairs with an R_{¬A} I¬-intro,
cut on `¬A` → cut on `A`), NOT a standalone 5.2.2 replace. **Two attack paths for axNeg:**
  - *Path C1:* prove axNeg can NEVER be the minimal-permissible non-chain premise on the ⊥-orbit (then the
    `htp`-false dispatch branch for axNeg is vacuous / unreachable). Check `iperm (L⁰_{¬p}) s` reachability.
  - *Path C2:* build a genuine succedent-replacement constructor that re-derives `Γ→p` using the `¬p ∈ Γ`
    side condition + the chain — i.e. follow Buchholz's actual ¬-axiom cut (restructures premises). Read
    `papers/buchholz-on-gentzens…md:80-95` (the `A,Θ→⊥ / Θ→A / Θ→D` triple for `V=¬A`).

### ▶ THE bottleneck remains the motive cascade — now CONSOLIDATED into `redZKReady` (lap 100 close)
`ZDerivation_red_zK`'s TWO replace sorries are GONE — its body is sorry-free, both branches discharged
(chain-Rep via `ZDerivation_red_zK_replace`, non-Rep via `ZDerivation_red_zK_nonRep`). The entire orbit
obligation is consolidated into ONE named predicate **`redZKReady s r ds`** (Crux2Blueprint, a plain `def`,
no definability needed) carrying per selected-premise `dᵢ`: (a) chain-Rep conclusion-tracking; (b) Seq-wff
conclusion; (c) selection-bounded threading/rank; (d) per-tag I∀/I¬/axAll freshness/faithful-ant/wff.
`redSoundGen`'s K-case now has the SINGLE residual `sorry : redZKReady s r ds`. **This is THE motive.**

**⭐ Lap-100 findings that SHARPEN the motive (consume next lap):**
- **The `tp` facts in redZKReady's chain-Rep field are FREE** — `tp_zK = isymRep` UNCONDITIONALLY
  (InternalZ:704), and `red` of a chain is again a chain, so `tp dᵢ = isymRep` and `tp (red dᵢ) = isymRep`
  need NOT be supplied. **redZKReady's chain-Rep field can be SLIMMED to just `fstIdx (red dᵢ) = fstIdx dᵢ`**
  (derive the two tp facts inside `ZDerivation_red_zK` from `tp_zK` + chain-shape-of-`red`). TODO next lap:
  slim the def, derive `htp`/`hredtp` locally via `zTag dᵢ = 4 ⟹ dᵢ = zK …` + `red_zK_rep` form.
- **The genuine hard residuals are exactly TWO:** (i) `fstIdx (red dᵢ) = fstIdx dᵢ` for a non-critical
  chain `dᵢ` — TRUE only when `dᵢ` is "Rep-reducing" (its OWN selected premise is Rep, route B `fstIdx_red`);
  this is HEREDITARY Rep-reduction, the core of Buchholz Thm 3.4's conclusion bookkeeping. (ii) the
  `permIdx ≤ j₀` selection bound feeding the threading/rank (NOT free even on ∅→⊥: `isChainInf`'s `j₀` is the
  Buchholz-non-critical top, and repo-`permIdx` is the GLOBAL least permissible; need the orbit fact
  "∃ permissible premise at index `≤ j₀`", banked half = `permIdx_le_of_isPermPrem`).
- **On a ∅→⊥ chain the non-Rep tag fields are VACUOUS** (Cor 2.1 `tp_selected_isymRep_of_emptyAnt_botSucc`:
  selected premise is Rep, so `znth ds permIdx = zIall/zIneg/zAxAll …` is FALSE → those implications hold by
  contradiction with `tp ≠ isymRep`). And `Seq (seqAnt s) = Seq ∅` is trivial there. So the ∅→⊥ special
  case of `redZKReady` reduces to JUST residuals (i)+(ii) above — a good first sub-lemma
  (`redZKReady_of_emptyAnt_botSucc`) to attempt next lap.

**Motive design (next lap, Path 1 refined):** strengthen `redSound`'s induction (NOT `redSoundGen`, which is
"false in general") to carry, per node, the route-B conclusion-tracking bundle `fstIdx (red d) = …` ∧ chain
Rep-reduction ∧ the threading (from `isChainInf` + `permIdx ≤ j₀`). The hereditary Rep-reduction (i) and the
selection bound (ii) are the genuine cut-elimination content left — this is multi-lap. The capstones +
dispatch + `redZKReady` consolidation mean EVERYTHING downstream of the invariants is now machine-checked.

### ⭐⭐ Lap-100 close: Thm 3.4(b) IS the motive invariant — but the repo `tp` ≠ Buchholz `tp` for CHAINS
Read `papers/buchholz-on-gentzens…md:98-104`. **Theorem 3.4(b): `d[n] ⊢ tp(d)(Π,n)`** — the reduct derives
the REDUCED endsequent, proven by simultaneous induction on build-up. This conclusion-tracking IS the motive
second conjunct: `fstIdx (red d) = ⟨Buchholz-reduced endsequent of d⟩`. **THE key subtlety (settles the
"hereditary Rep" confusion):** the repo's `tp (zK s r ds) = isymRep` UNCONDITIONALLY (`tp_zK`), but
Buchholz's `tp(d)` for a non-critical chain (case 5.2.2) is `tp(dᵢ)` — the SELECTED PREMISE's type. So the
chain reduct's conclusion is `tpReduce (tp dᵢ) (fstIdx d) 0` (reduced by the PREMISE's tp), NOT
`tpReduce (tp(zK)) … = id`. Confirmed by `red_zK_rep_nonchain`: `fstIdx (red (zK)) = tpReduce (tp dᵢ) s 0`.
⟹ **the conclusion-tracking is inherently case-split on the selected premise's tag — which is EXACTLY what
`redZKReady` encodes.** There is no single clean `fstIdx (red d) = f(tp d)` formula; the per-tag structure is
forced. **Lap-100 banked two motive bricks:** `tp_red_isymRep_of_zTag_4` (chain-Rep tp facts free) +
`fstIdx_red_zK_of_selected_Rep` (Rep-reduction off ∅→⊥, reduced to "selected premise Rep-or-critical").

**Next-lap concrete plan:** (1) define the motive predicate `redTracks d : Prop := ZDerivation (red d) ∧
fstIdx (red d) = ⟨per-tag reduced endsequent⟩ ∧ redZKReady-style data`, hereditary; (2) prove its 5 leaf/
non-chain cases (atom/I∀/I¬/Ind/ax) from the banked `red_z*_tpReduce` tracking lemmas; (3) the K-case
consumes the IH's tracking at the selected premise to discharge `redZKReady`'s chain-Rep `fstIdx` field
(`tp dᵢ = Rep ⟹ tpReduce = id`) and routes non-Rep via the capstones — the ONLY genuinely-open inputs left
being the threading selection bound `permIdx ≤ j₀` (orbit fact) + the per-tag freshness (O3) + axNeg.

## 📋 Lap 99 — FULL crux-2 sorry inventory + dependency structure (unblock-protocol)
**Build 🟢 1325. Headline `[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms).** Every open crux-2
sorry and how they depend:

| sorry | what | depends on | independent? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Reduction.lean:68` `goodstein_implies_consistency` | THE headline obligation | crux-1 (DONE, wip) ∘ crux-2; needs WIRING | no — top |
| `Crux2Blueprint:206` chain-replace | non-critical chain dᵢ (Rep) | `red_rep_of_tp_isymRep` hsel = dᵢ's own selected premise is Rep (hereditary ⊥-orbit invariant) | needs orbit invariant |
| `Crux2Blueprint:227` non-Rep replace | I∀/I¬/axAll/axNeg selected premise | **strengthened motive** (Seq-wff + O3-fresh + ∃perm≤j₀); validity-layer infra DONE lap 99 | THE active front |
| `Crux2Blueprint:183` splice | 5.2.1 `iSpliceEnd` validity | `ZDerivation_seqInsert_of` + spliced isChainInf | partial |
| `Crux2Blueprint:80,99` | iIndReduct validity / iRcritG | banked iCrit constructors | partial |
| `Crux2Blueprint:295` `iord_descent_red` | ordinal descent over red | **strengthened motive** (per-premise ordinal IH: iotil/idg); banked `iord_descent_iCritAux`/`_seqInsert`/critical | parallel to :227, SAME motive |
| `Crux2Blueprint:338` `foundation_bot_to_Z_empty` | M2 embedding (Foundation⊥→ZDerivesEmptyR) | Bryce–Goré Peano.v (~1k lines) | **YES — fully independent of redSound** |
| `Crux2Blueprint:350` `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` | M3 (descent ⟹ False) | iord_red_iterate_descends (= :295) + PRWO well-foundedness | downstream of :295 |

**KEY STRUCTURAL FINDING:** the validity side (:206,:227) AND the descent side (:295) BOTH route through one
strengthened `redSoundGen` induction motive carrying, per premise: (1) conclusion-tracking
(`fstIdx (red dᵢ) = tpReduce …`, banked for all node types), (2) sequent-wellformedness (`Seq (seqAnt s)`
+ wff — NOT in ZDerivation, `seqAnt s = π₁ s`; preservation banked `Seq_seqAnt_seqAddAnt`), (3) O3-freshness
(I∀ eigenvar fresh — NOT in ZRegular/zIallWff), (4) the ordinal IH (`iotil (red dᵢ) ≺ iotil dᵢ`, `idg ≤`).
**THE motive cascade is the single bottleneck for ~5 of the 8 sorries.** The M2 bridge (:338) is the only
genuinely independent deep thread.

### Three attack paths for the motive cascade (the bottleneck)
- *Path 1 (recommended): define `ZGood d : Prop` as a Fixpoint* = hereditary (validity ∧ Seq-wff-conclusion
  ∧ O3-fresh ∧ regular), prove it's `𝚫₁`-definable, the embedding produces it, `red` preserves it. Then
  strengthen `redSoundGen`/`iord_descent_red` motives to `ZGood d → … ∧ ZGood (red d)`. Big (new Fixpoint +
  heredity), but it's THE clean structural object. Validity-layer + descent infra all banked to consume it.
- *Path 2: bundle the invariants into `ZDerivesEmptyR`* (the orbit predicate) as explicit conjuncts and
  thread them as hypotheses through `redSoundGen` WITHOUT a new Fixpoint — discharge the heredity inline
  per node. Less infrastructure, more per-lemma plumbing; risks not being hereditary without the Fixpoint.
- *Path 3: attack M2 (`foundation_bot_to_Z_empty`) instead* — the independent thread. Port Bryce–Goré
  Peano.v's B1–B3 (PA-axioms→Z, modus-ponens→chain-rule, induction→Z-Ind). Doesn't unblock redSound but is
  mandatory and parallelizable; a partial embedding with disclosed sub-sorries is real progress.

---

## 📍 Lap 100 (ordinal side) — iord_descent_red dispatch + Ind leaf banked
`iord_descent_red` (Crux2Blueprint, `icmp (iord (red d)) (iord d) = 0` over `ZDerivesEmptyR`) is the
ORDINAL companion of `redSound`, structurally PARALLEL to `ZDerivation_red_zK`. Orbit `d` is only Ind or K
(`zTag_Ind_or_K_of_ZDerivesEmpty`). **Lap-100 banked `iord_descent_red_zInd`** (the Ind leaf, axiom-clean,
via `iord_descent_iRInd_of_ZDerivation`). **K-case ordinal residual** mirrors the validity dispatch: banked
per-branch descents `iord_descent_iRcrit_of_chain` (5.1 critical), `iord_descent_iCritAux`/`_iCritReduct_
object` (5.2.2 replace), `iord_descent_seqInsert`/`_iSpliceEnd` (5.2.1 splice). NOTE: `iord_descent_iR2_of_
ZDerivesEmpty` (banked) needs `hcrit` (chain critical) — only the 5.1 case; the non-critical K-case descent
is the genuine residual, needing the same selection-bound + per-tag structure as `redZKReady`. Next-lap:
consolidate the K-case ordinal residual into an `iordDescentReady`-style obligation (mirror `redZKReady`),
or attack the shared motive (which feeds BOTH validity + ordinal sides per the lap-99 structural finding).

## 📍 Lap 99 — VALIDITY LAYER + selection bound DONE; remaining = O3-freshness motive + assembly
**Build 🟢 1325. Headline `[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms). Lap-97's
"architectural wall" RESOLVED (the eigensubst rewire landed lap 97; `red (zIall) = zsubst d0 a 0`).**

The two open `sorry`s are `ZDerivation_red_zK`'s replace branches (`Crux2Blueprint.lean:206,214`). Lap 99
built **the entire validity layer** for them, all axiom-clean:
- `ZDerivation_iCritReplaceReduce_of` (R-rule succedent-reduction constructor)
- `ZDerivation_zK_seqAddAnt` (L-rule axAll antecedent-weakening constructor)
- `tpReduce_tp_zAxAll/zAxNeg` (conclusion-tracking, all node types — frontier item 1 DONE)
- `permIdx_le_of_isPermPrem` ⟹ **`permIdx ≤ j₀`** (Buchholz §5.2 selection bound)

### The THREE remaining pieces to discharge the two `sorry`s (attack paths)
**A. O3-freshness invariant + motive strengthening (THE gating residual).** `red_zIall_tpReduce` (the I∀
conclusion-tracking) needs `fvSubst a 0 p = p` and `fvSubstSeq a 0 (seqAnt sᵢ) = seqAnt sᵢ` — the
eigenvariable `a` fresh in the matrix `p` and antecedent `Γ`. **CONFIRMED lap 99: this is NOT in
`ZRegular` (`zReg_zIall` gives only `maxEigen d0 < a`) nor `zIallWff` (gives only `seqAnt(fstIdx d0)=seqAnt s`,
`seqSucc=p(a)`, `IsSemiformula 1 p`).** It is a genuine extra embedding invariant (O3).
  - *Path A1 (recommended):* define a hereditary `ZFresh d : Prop` (eigenvars fresh in their matrices+ants,
    hereditarily) + prove `ZFresh` preserved by `red`/the embedding produces it; thread it as a second
    motive conjunct in `redSoundGen` alongside `ZRegular`.
  - *Path A2:* fold O3 into `ZRegular` itself (extend `zReg_zIall` to also flag `a ∈ FV(p)∪FV(Γ)`), so the
    existing `ZRegular` threading carries it. Cleaner if `zReg`'s definition can name `fvSubst` cheaply.
  - *Path A3 (cheapest unblock):* take O3 as an explicit hypothesis on `redSound`/`ZDerivesEmptyR` (the
    orbit predicate) and discharge it at the M2 embedding (`foundation_bot_to_Z_empty`) where the fresh
    eigenvariable is CHOSEN. Defers the heredity proof to the embedding.

**B. Threading restriction (trivial, ~5 lines).** From the parent `isChainInf` witness `j₀` + `permIdx ≤ j₀`
(via `permIdx_le_of_isPermPrem` given a permissible premise ≤ j₀), restrict `∀i'≤j₀`/`∀i'<j₀` to
`∀i'≤permIdx`/`∀i'<permIdx` by `le_trans`. Feeds `ZDerivation_iCritReplaceReduce_of`'s `hthread`/`hrank`.

**C. axNeg succedent-replacement constructor (medium).** `tpReduce_tp_zAxNeg = seqSetSucc Π p` (succedent
REPLACEMENT, not weakening — distinct from axAll). Needs a `ZDerivation (zK (seqSetSucc s p) r ds)` from
`ZDerivation (zK s r ds)` constructor; Buchholz §5 ¬-axiom cut restructures premises, so read the PDF
(buchholz-on-gentzens md line 90, the `Θ→A` conclusion). Also: confirm axNeg CAN be selected (`¬p ∈ Γ`).

Then: dispatch line 206 (chain dᵢ = Rep) via `ZDerivation_red_zK_replace`; line 214 (non-chain) by node
type — atom/Ind→Rep, I∀/I¬→`ZDerivation_iCritReplaceReduce_of`, axAll→`ZDerivation_zK_seqAddAnt`,
axNeg→(C). Wff side-conditions (hf1_v…) extract from the premise's `ZDerivation` (note `zIallF` wff is
`IsSemiformula 1`, reconcile with `IsUFormula`).

---

## 📍 Lap 97 — ⛔ THE WALL IS ARCHITECTURAL: `red` cannot do the eigenvariable substitution
(SUPERSEDED — the architectural wall was resolved by the lap-97 eigensubst rewire; kept for history.)

**Build 🟢 1325. Headline `[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms). `ZRegular_red` banked
(axiom-clean) — full O1 regularity-preservation, `Zsubst.lean`.**

### The precise diagnosis (settles laps 90–96's stalled route-B)
The genuine cut-elimination residual is `ZDerivation_red_zK` **case 2** (non-chain selected premise,
`Crux2Blueprint.lean:256`). When the selected premise `dᵢ` is an **I∀ node** (the ∀-principal-cut), Buchholz
reduces the conclusion to `Θ→F(0)` (`tpReduce (isymR ∀p) s 0`, `InternalZ.lean:1084`) AND must instantiate
the eigenvariable in the premise: the replacement at position `i` must be **`zsubst d0 a (numeral 0)`**
(`d0(a/0)`), NOT `d0`. But the repo's `red` puts `red(zIall …) = d0` (deriving `Γ→F(a)`, eigenvar `a`),
so `red (chain)` = `zK (Θ→F(0)) r (seqUpdate ds i d0)` is **genuinely unsound** (d0 derives F(a)≠F(0)).
No downstream proof can fix a wrong VALUE — `red`'s value itself must change to do the eigensubst.

### Why it can't be fixed in place (the lap-96 plan is dead)
`red`/`iRNextG`/`iRKr` live in **`InternalZ.lean`**; `zsubst` lives in **`Zsubst.lean`** (imports InternalZ,
strictly downstream). So `iRNextG` literally cannot name `zsubst`. And `red`'s definition block is **tangled**
through InternalZ's tail (lines 6190–7409) with `iR2`, `ZDerivesEmpty` (def at 6935), and the
`zDerivation_*_inv` lemmas — NOT a clean cut to relocate. This is why ~18 laps stalled.

### Heredity check (done, by reasoning): hereditary Cor 2.1 is FALSE
On the ⊥-orbit the TOP chain's selected premise is Rep (Cor 2.1, `tpReduce isymRep = id`), but `red`
recurses into that Rep premise's OWN selected premise, which is permissible for *its* (non-⊥) conclusion —
where I∀/axiom (non-Rep) selected premises DO occur. So the eigensubst case is genuinely reachable.

### ▶ Resolution options (next lap executes — this is a real pivot)
**⭐ RECOMMENDED (NEW, de-risked lap-97): move the `zsubst` DEFINITION upstream, then rewire `iRNextG` in
place.** KEY enabler: **`FvSubst.lean` is independent of `InternalZ`** (imports only Foundation; the 2
"InternalZ/zIall" refs are comments). So `InternalZ` CAN `import GoodsteinPA.FvSubst`. Then:
  - Add `import GoodsteinPA.FvSubst` to InternalZ (line 21 area).
  - Move the zsubst DEFINITIONAL block `Zsubst.lean:34–~400` UP into InternalZ, placed BEFORE `red`
    (line 6190) and after the zIall/zK accessors: `fvSubstSeqAux`/`fvSubstSeq`/`fvSubstSeqt`,
    `tblMapSeqAux`/`tblMapSeq`, `zIallEig`/`zAxAllK` + the per-tag accessors (`zIallF`/`zInegF`/`zIndP`/
    `zIndEig`/`zIndTerm`), `zsubstNext`/`zsubstTable`/`zsubst` + their `*Def`/`*_defined` instances. These
    are DEFINITIONS (+ definability), NOT proofs — low tactic-fragility. The hard THEOREMS
    (`ZDerivation_zsubst`/`iord_zsubst`/`zReg_zsubst`, `Zsubst.lean:1281+/2003+`) STAY in Zsubst and now
    reference the upstream def.
  - Rewire `iRNextG` tag-1 = `zsubst (zIallPrem d) (zIallEig d) (numeral 0)`; re-prove `iRNextG_defined`
    (add `zsubst_defined.iff`/`zIallEig_defined.iff`/`numeralGraph`), `red_zIall = zsubst d0 a (numeral 0)`.
  - Fix the 3 consumers: `ZRegular_red_of_not_zK` zIall case (use `zReg_zsubst _ _ _ hd0`); `redSoundGen`
    zIall case → thread `ZRegular` so `ZDerivation_zsubst` gives `maxEigen d0 < a`; `red_zIall`'s simp uses.
  This is the cleanest path: ~370 lines of DEFINITIONS move up (vs ~1200 tangled lines of red+proofs down).
  Banked `iord_zsubst`/`ZRegular_red`/`zReg_zsubst` transfer unchanged (descent + regularity are
  conclusion-independent). **⚠ scope: a full lap; do NOT leave InternalZ red across a turn — land green or
  stash to wip/.**

Fallbacks (only if the move proves intractable): a PARALLEL downstream reduct `redC` (duplicates the table);
or confine to a ∀-cut-free fragment (too weak for the PA embedding — rejected).

### What lap 97 banked
- `ZRegular_red` (`Zsubst.lean`): `∀ d, ZDerivation d → ZRegular d → ZRegular (red d)`, axiom-clean — the
  full O1 half, ready to transfer to the relocated/parallel reduct (regularity is conclusion-independent;
  `zReg_zsubst` already covers the eigensubst case).

## 📍 Lap 95 — FRESH-MIND REVIEW: the wall is a SURGICAL dispatch gate (confirms Path X)

**Build 🟢 1325. Headline `[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms), re-verified in-kernel.**
Primary deliverables: `ANALYSIS-2026-06-25-lap95-dispatch-fix-not-pivot.md` + `wip/InternalZdispatch.lean`
(de-risk spike, axiom-clean). **Direction KEPT, Path X (lap-92 DECISION) CONFIRMED + SHARPENED.**

**The sharpened picture (corrects the "2–3k-line ω-rule pivot" framing).** Reading the kernel state:
- **O2 DONE** — `ZDerivation_zsubst` (`Zsubst.lean:1855`, axiom-clean) is the benign criticality-free
  eigensubst lemma; route-B reducts consume it. NOT a wall.
- **O1 DONE except one leaf** — `ZRegular_red_zK` (`Zsubst.lean:1788`) is fully proved *modulo the single
  hypothesis `hseltag`* (not a sorry — a clean lemma awaiting one true fact).
- **The wall = ONE false hypothesis.** `hseltag` (splice ⟹ `zTag dᵢ = 4`) is FALSE under the current `iRK`
  (`not_permIdx_lt_zKseq_zAtom`): the splice fires by default on non-chain selected premises.
- **Fix = surgical gate**, NOT a rewrite. Gate `iRK`'s splice on `zTag dᵢ = 4 ∧ ¬ permIdx dᵢ < lh(zKseq dᵢ)`
  (= dᵢ a *critical chain*); route non-chains to replace (= Buchholz Def 3.2 case 5.2.2). Behaviour is
  identical for chains; only non-chain selected premises change (junk splice → replace). The ω-rule
  *selection* reading is the SOUNDNESS justification, not a reason to rebuild a new node/`Fixpoint`.

**✅ THIS LAP (lap 95) — STEP 1 LANDED IN-KERNEL (green 1325, axiom-clean).** The gate is PORTED IN-PLACE,
not just spiked:
- `iRK` (`InternalZ.lean:6108`) now gates the splice on `zTag dᵢ = 4 ∧ ¬ permIdx dᵢ < lh(zKseq dᵢ)`;
  `iRKDef`/`iRK_defined` updated (extra `zTag dᵢ` term + a `zTag dᵢ = 4` case in the definability proof);
  `fstIdx_iRK`/`zTag_iRK` re-proved (`split_ifs <;> simp`).
- `red_zK_rep` (proof) / `red_zK_splice` (gains `htag : zTag dᵢ = 4`) + NEW `red_zK_rep_nonchain` (non-chain
  → replace) in BOTH `Zsubst.lean` and the local copies in `Crux2Blueprint.lean`.
- **`ZRegular_red_zK` (`Zsubst.lean`) is now UNCONDITIONAL** — `hseltag` DROPPED, `#print axioms =
  [propext, choice, Quot.sound]`. The lap-94 regularity wall is cleared in-kernel; the obstruction
  docstring is marked RESOLVED (`not_permIdx_lt_zKseq_zAtom` kept as the in-kernel record of *why*).
- `Crux2Blueprint.ZDerivation_red_zK` dispatch restructured to the gated 3+1-way form (the non-chain
  replace case = a disclosed `sorry` = the deep validity residual below). Headline `#print axioms`
  unchanged: `[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms). Spike `wip/InternalZdispatch.lean`
  REMOVED (superseded — content promoted to src/).

**▶ NEXT (priority order).**
1. **Validity half** (the genuinely deep residual): rewire the replace branch to emit the conclusion-reduced
   `tpReduce (tp dᵢ) Π n` (`tpReduce` Σ₁-def'd `InternalZ.lean:1064`); prove `ZDerivation_red_zK_rep`/`_splice`/
   `_crit` (Crux2Blueprint sorries) on the reduced conclusions. Lap-90 stands: keep-Π `red` is faithful only
   for `tp = Rep`, so conclusion-reduction is mandatory here.
2. **`iord_descent_red`** (`icmp (iord (red d)) (iord d) = 0`, Crux2Blueprint:306) — assemble from the banked
   per-branch descent lemmas under the now-faithful dispatch.
3. **Wire** `Crux2Blueprint → false_of_ZDerivesEmpty → goodstein_implies_consistency → headline`; drop the
   `Statement.lean` headline `sorry`; confirm `#print axioms peano_not_proves_goodstein` is trust-base-clean.

**Aristotle:** idle (all jobs IDLE). Fodder candidate = the in-place `iRKfix_defined` (Σ₁ semisentence,
mechanical port of `iRKDef`) once the gate is ported, or a self-contained `tpReduce` commutation lemma.

## 📍 Lap 92 — DEEP REFLECTION: ω-rule pivot (route C) recommended

**Build 🟢 1325. Headline `[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms). No proof code — synthesis lap.**
Primary deliverable: `REFLECTION-2026-06-25-lap92.md`. STATUS lap-92 box + HANDOFF-lap92 updated.

**The call.** crux-2 `redSound` is the right target; the *finitary eigenvariable* sub-route is the source of
the laps-78–91 stall. ⭐ **CORRECTION (later this lap, in-kernel — `ANALYSIS-2026-06-25-lap92-criticality-wall-is-gone.md`):**
`ZPhi` already uses criticality-free **`zKValidF`** (lap-82 re-point is LIVE), and `ZDerivation_zsubst` is green
⟹ **the lap-78 "substitution wall" is GONE** (CE-1/CE-2 attack ONLY the criticality conjunct, no longer in
validity). Lap-91's **O2 is mislabeled** — it is NOT the lap-78 wall. The genuine residual is the **O1↔O2
freshness/eigensubst COUPLING** intrinsic to finitary ∀: eigensubst (O2) needs `aNotEigen` regularity, which
needs freshness tracking in the Wff predicates (O1). TWO honest paths now:
- **Path X (stay finitary):** add eigenvariable-freshness to `zIallWff`/`zIndWff` (O1) + prove
  `ZDerivation_zsubst_eigen` (substitute eigenvariable by closed numeral, `aNotEigen`, preserving `zKValidF`)
  (O2). Lower architectural risk; NO LONGER known-blocked (lap-78's blocker removed).
- **Path C (ω-rule pivot):** Buchholz §6 `Z^∞`, as `Zinfty.lean` (meta, axiom-clean) + Bryce–Goré's Coq do.
  A critical cut *selects* premise `dₙ` instead of substituting ⟹ O1+O2+`tpReduce` all vanish. Higher one-time
  cost, removes the coupling permanently.

**⭐ DECISION (end of lap 92 — `DECISION-2026-06-25-lap92-path-X-favored.md`): Path X favored.** The ω-rule
precedents (`Zinfty.lean`, Bryce–Goré) are META-level (premises = native functions); they do NOT de-risk the
arithmetized ω-rule (Σ₁ `Z*` notations over codes), which is the un-precedented hard part the repo chose
finitary to avoid. Path X completes the invested finitary arithmetization with standard bookkeeping, and O1
is now shown **tractable + maintainable** via the key insight: `zsubst` (closed term) **preserves eigenvariable
indices**, so a freshness invariant phrased on eigenvariable indices (`maxEigen premise < eigenvar`) is
**stable through `red`** (the code-bound `d≤a` was not). Path C is the fallback only if step 4 below walls.

**NEXT — Path X foundation lemmas (concrete, low-risk, reuse the `idg` recursion template):**
1. **✅ DONE (lap 92, `Zsubst.lean`, axiom-clean, green 1325):** `maxEigen d` defined + `𝚺₁`-definable
   (`maxEigenNext`/`maxEigenTable`/`maxEigenDef`) via the `idg`/`PR.Construction` template. `maxEigenNext`
   folds `zIallEig`/`zIndEig` over the premise table; chains use `iseqMaxTab`.
2. **✅ DONE (lap 93, `Zsubst.lean`, axiom-clean, green 1325): recursion equations + stability.**
   (a) `maxEigen_zAtom`/`_zIall`(`= max a (maxEigen d0)`)/`_zIneg`/`_zInd`(`= max (π₁ at') (max …)`)/
   `_zAxAll`/`_zAxNeg`/`_zAx1`/`_zK`(`= iseqMaxEigen ds`) — via the `idg` structural-correctness template
   (`def_maxEigenTable`/`maxEigenTable_seq`/`_lh`/`znth_maxEigenTable_eq_maxEigen`/`maxEigen_eq_maxEigenNext`
   + the `iseqMaxEigen` fold mirroring `iseqMaxIdg`/`idg_zK`). (b) **`maxEigen_zsubst (a t) : ∀ d,
   ZDerivation d → maxEigen (zsubst d a t) = maxEigen d`** — the substitution-stability crux, by
   `zDerivation_induction` + the recursion equations + `zsubst_zIall`/`zInd` preserving the eigenvariable
   + fold congruence `iseqMaxEigenAux_congr` (chain). `#print axioms` = `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`.
3. **✅ DONE (lap 93, `Zsubst.lean`, axiom-clean, green 1325): `ZDerivation_zsubst` reformulated** from
   `d ≤ a` to `maxEigen d < a`. Relocated the `maxEigen` block above `ZDerivation_zsubst`; added the
   fold-bound `le_iseqMaxEigen` (mirror `le_iseqMaxTab`); each case derives `e ≠ a` + the recursive
   premise bound from the `maxEigen` recursion eqs (`le_max_left/right` for `zIall`/`zInd`, `le_iseqMaxEigen`
   for `zK`). The dead sequent bound `hsa : s ≤ a` is removed (never used). Corollaries
   `ZDerivation_zsubst_zIall_premise`/`_zInd_premise1` retargeted to `maxEigen d0 < a` / `maxEigen d1 < π₁ at'`.
4. **O1 — ARCHITECTURE CHANGED (lap 93): additive `zReg`, NOT a `zIallWff` edit.** Baking freshness into
   `zIallWff` reshapes the `ZDerivation` fixpoint (blueprint/definability/embedding all break — large blast
   radius). Instead, **✅ DONE (lap 93, `Zsubst.lean`, axiom-clean, green 1325):** a standalone `𝚺₁`
   *hereditary-freshness* function `zReg d` (violation count; `0` iff regular), built on the `maxEigen`/`idg`
   table template (`ltFlag`/`zRegNext`/`zRegTable` + recursion eqs `zReg_zAtom`/`_zIall`(`max (ltFlag (maxEigen
   d0) a) (zReg d0)`)/`_zIneg`/`_zInd`/`_zAx*`/`_zK`(`iseqReg ds`)). Predicate `ZRegular d := zReg d = 0`.
   Route-B bridges `maxEigen_lt_of_regular_zIall`/`_zInd` (regular node ⟹ the `maxEigen d0 < a` / `maxEigen d1
   < π₁ at'` that reformulated `ZDerivation_zsubst` consumes). Substitution step `zReg_zsubst` (ZDerivation d ⟹
   `zReg (zsubst d a t) = zReg d`) — regularity preserved by closed-term subst. `#print axioms` clean.
5. **`red` preserves `ZRegular` — structural + Ind cases DONE (lap 93, `Zsubst.lean`, axiom-clean, green
   1325).** `ZRegular_red_of_not_zK` covers atom/zIall(→d0)/zIneg(→d0)/zInd(→`iRInd`)/zAxAll/zAxNeg. KEY
   simplification found: `iRInd (zInd …) = zK s (irk p) (iIndReductSeq d0 d1 1)` is a chain over the
   *literal* premises `⟨d1,d0⟩` — **no substitution at the Ind level** — so its `zReg = max (zReg d1) (zReg
   d0) = 0`. Added the `iseqReg` fold lemmas (`_seqCons`/`_const`/`_iRepeatSeq`/`_iIndReductSeq`,
   `iseqRegAux_znth_congr`) mirroring `iseqMaxIdg`.
6. **`zK` chain case — reusable building blocks DONE (lap 93, `Zsubst.lean`, axiom-clean, green 1325).**
   `ZRegular_zK_of_premises` (a chain all of whose premises are regular IS regular; via `iseqReg_eq_zero_of`)
   and `ZRegular_zAxReduct` (the per-premise atomic reduct preserves regularity — it returns `zAx1`/identity).
   All three `iRK` branches produce a chain over regular reducts, so these are the shared closing lemmas.
7. **`zK`-case reduct-regularity helpers DONE (lap 93, axiom-clean, green 1325):** `le_iseqReg`,
   `ZRegular_zK_premise` (premise of a regular chain is regular), `ZRegular_zK_of_seqUpdate` (5.2.2 `iRKr`
   + each half of 5.1 `iRKc`), `ZRegular_zK_of_iCritReductSeq` (5.1 `iRKc` outer chain). The `iRKr`/`iRKc`
   branches close from these (premises regular via `ZRegular_zK_premise` + IH `ZRegular (red premise)` via
   `znth_redTable_eq_red`; the per-premise reduct regular via `ZRegular_zAxReduct`).
8. **⚠ STRUCTURAL FINDING (lap 93): `red`-preserves-`ZRegular` for the `zK` case is NOT standalone — it needs
   `zKValidF`.** The 5.2.1 splice `iRKs` reads `a,b = znth (zKseq (red dᵢ)) 0/1` where `dᵢ = znth ds permIdx`.
   `zReg a ≤ zReg (red dᵢ)` holds ONLY when `red dᵢ` is a genuine `K`-chain (tag 4) — which requires
   `zTag dᵢ = 4`, a fact that only holds for *valid* derivations (`zKValidF`'s `isChainInf`/criticality
   data), NOT from `ZDerivation`+`ZRegular` alone (a pathological non-tag-4 `dᵢ` would take the `iRKs` branch
   and produce junk halves). **⟹ regularity preservation belongs INSIDE the `redSound` induction** (where
   `zKValidF` is in scope), not as a separate `red_preserves_ZRegular`. The lap-93 helpers are exactly the
   tools that induction will use.
9. **← START HERE: `redSound` with regularity threaded.** Prove "red of a VALID, regular contradiction
   derivation is a valid, regular ZDerivation" by the `redTable`/`zDerivation_induction`, using `zKValidF`
   to pin `zTag dᵢ = 4` in the `iRKs` branch + the lap-93 helpers + the route-B bridges
   (`maxEigen_lt_of_regular_zIall`/`_zInd`) at the I∀/Ind validity steps. Then embedding ⟹ regular, then
   `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` → headline. Inspect existing `redSound`/`RedSound` scaffolding first (laps 82-90).
2. **(Path X) — ✅ O2 BANKED this lap (`Zsubst.lean`, axiom-clean):** `ZDerivation_zsubst_zIall_premise`
   and `ZDerivation_zsubst_zInd_premise1` discharge the route-B I∀/Ind eigensubst reducts **directly from
   the existing `ZDerivation_zsubst`**, under the freshness bound `d0 ≤ a` / `d1 ≤ π₁ at'`. This
   kernel-certifies the corrected diagnosis: O2 needs NO new substitution lemma. **The entire residual is
   now O1** = produce the bound `premise ≤ eigenvariable`, i.e. add eigenvariable-freshness to
   `zIallWff`/`zIndWff` AND maintain it through `red`. Sharpened next target: decide the freshness predicate
   — a code-bound `d0 < a` (makes the corollary apply directly but is NOT substitution-stable through `red`)
   vs the genuine Buchholz condition `e ∉ FV(ant)` + distinctness (substitution-stable by closed numeral, but
   needs reformulating the corollary's hypothesis from `≤` to that predicate). The maintenance-through-`red`
   of whichever freshness invariant is the real O1 difficulty — and is exactly what Path C (ω-rule) avoids.
3. **(Path C)** `wip/InternalZomega.lean`: ω-rule ∀-node `zAllOmega s g`, premise-n `= appPrem g n` (Σ₁ lookup
   into notation `g`, reusing `zK`/`zKseq`/`iIndReductSeq`); critical-cut reduct = `appPrem g n`, no `substs1`/
   `zsubst`. Then Σ₁-definability of `appPrem`, then port the axiom-clean `iord` engine + `Zinfty` cut-elim
   cases (`orInv`/`allInv`/`cutElimStep` are worked meta templates). ~2–3k-line rebuild.

**STOP:** finitary `tpReduce` conclusion-tracking + new `Zsubst`/`ZDerivation_zsubst` eigenvariable lemmas.
**KEEP (reusable under route C):** `red_zK_rep/_splice`, `tp_*`, `red_rep_of_tp_isymRep`,
`tp_isymRep_of_emptyAnt_botSucc` (the `tp`-dispatch survives; only substitution → selection changes); the
axiom-clean `iord` engine; `Zinfty.lean` as template.

## 📍 Lap 91 — route-B keystone `tpReduce` defined + 𝚺₁-definable

**Build 🟢 1325. Headline `[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms). 2 green commits.**

Lap-90 forced route B (faithful Buchholz reduct with conclusion reduction). Step 1 landed:
- ✅ **`tpReduce I s n`** (`InternalZ.lean`, after `inAnt_seqAddAnt`) = Buchholz's reduced sequent
  `I(Π,n)` (from the PDF §2 14.23/14.252): `Rep→Π`, `R_∀xF→Θ→F(n)`, `R_¬A→A,Θ→⊥`,
  `L^k_∀xF→F(k),Θ→D`, `L^0_¬A→Θ→A`. ∀/¬ dispatch on `π₁(A∸1)=6`; ¬-body via `IsUFormula.neg_neg`.
  All 5 per-symbol equations proved axiom-clean (`tpReduce_isymRep` is `@[simp]`).
- ✅ **`tpReduceDef` / `tpReduce_defined` / `_definable` / `_definable'`** (after `seqAddAnt_definable`)
  — `tpReduce` is `𝚺₁`-definable (subDef peels the qq `+1`).

**✅ lap-91 also landed `fstIdx_red_eq_tpReduce_of_Rep`** (`InternalZ.lean`): the route-B conclusion
invariant for the `Rep` case (`zTag ∈ {3,4}`), = the headline ⊥-orbit specialisation, axiom-clean.

**⚠️ TWO OBSTRUCTIONS FOUND (lap 91, the genuine route-B walls — map before grinding):**

**(O1) `zIallWff` does NOT track the eigenvariable freshness `a ∉ FV(Γ)`** (`InternalZ.lean:1542`:
`zIallWff = seqAnt(fstIdx d0)=seqAnt s ∧ seqSucc(fstIdx d0)=substs1 (^&a) p ∧ IsSemiformula 1 p`).
So `ZDerivation (zIall …)` carries no freshness. Route B's I∀ conclusion `Γ→F(0)` needs `Γ[a/0]=Γ`,
i.e. `a ∉ FV(Γ)`. ⟹ **rung-0.5 redux**: strengthen `zIallWff` (and `zIndWff`) with the freshness
conjunct (blast radius: every `zIall`/`zInd` builder must supply it). On the headline ⊥-orbit the
sub-derivations reached have `Γ = ∅` (lap-90), so freshness is MOOT there — a restricted
empty-antecedent I∀ lemma sidesteps O1 for the headline, IF O2 is solved.

**(O2) eigenvariable substitution `d₀(a/n)` is NOT `ZDerivation_zsubst`** (`Zsubst.lean:834`). That
theorem requires `d ≤ a` (substitution variable larger than all codes — fresh, non-clashing). The
route-B I∀ reduct substitutes the *eigenvariable* `e = zIallEig` which genuinely occurs in `d₀`
(small index, `d₀ ⋬ e`), so `ZDerivation_zsubst` does not apply. This is the lap-78 "criticality
substitution wall" again: eigen-subst is a SEPARATE, harder substitution lemma (the eigenvar appears
in the derivation, not a fresh slot). **Genuine next deep target** = an eigenvariable-substitution
ZDerivation lemma (`zsubst d₀ e t` valid when `e` is `d₀`'s genuine eigenvar, freshness from the rule).

**⚠️ (O3) The route-B invariant must be ANTECEDENT-MEMBERSHIP-EQUIVALENCE, not raw `fstIdx =`.**
Buchholz sequents are sets; the repo codes antecedents as `seqCons` sequences with `inAnt` membership,
and the per-rule `…Wff` predicates track the antecedent INCONSISTENTLY: `zIallWff` pins
`seqAnt(fstIdx d0) = seqAnt s` EXACTLY, but `zInegWff` only pins `inAnt p (seqAnt(fstIdx d0))`
(membership). So `fstIdx (red (zIneg …)) = tpReduce (R_¬A) Π 0` FAILS as raw equality (`red zIneg = d0`
has antecedent `Γ'∋p`, not the canonical `seqCons Γ p`). ⟹ state the invariant as: `red d` derives a
sequent with succedent `= seqSucc (tpReduce …)` AND antecedent `≈` (same membership-set as)
`seqAnt (tpReduce …)`. The chain-rule threading already consumes antecedents via `inAnt` only
(`isChainInf`/`chainAnt` at `InternalZ.lean:1157`), so it is robust to this — the invariant equivalence
suffices to rebuild parent chains. **`tpReduce` gives the canonical representative; the invariant is
up-to-`inAnt`-equality to it.** (Headline ⊥-orbit's `fstIdx_red_eq_tpReduce_of_Rep` is EXACT — `Π=∅→⊥`,
no antecedent ambiguity — so O3 only bites in the general structural induction, not the headline rung.)

**⭐ O2 FULLY DECOMPOSED (lap 91) — the route-B I∀ reduct `d₀(a/n) = zsubst d0 a (numeral n)` needs
exactly THREE lemmas, all gated on the eigenvariable freshness (O1, `a ∉ FV(Γ→∀xF)`):**
- **(O2a) eigenvar-plug commutation** `fvSubst a t (substs1 ℒₒᵣ ^&a p) = substs1 ℒₒᵣ t p` under
  `a ∉ FV(p)` — the succedent `F(a)→F(t)` step. NOT in repo/Foundation (only the `a'≠a` variant
  `fvSubst_substs1_fvar` exists, `FvSubst.lean:567`). A Foundation-level formula-induction lemma.
- **(O2b) antecedent freshness** `fvSubstSeq a t Γ = Γ` under `a ∉ FV(Γ)` (= `seqAnt s`). The repo's
  `fvSubst_eq_self_of_le` (`FvSubst.lean:441`) gives this only for the SIZE-fresh `p ≤ a` form; need the
  genuine-freshness `a ∉ FV` form (per-element of the `Γ` sequence).
- **(O2c) eigen-subst validity** `ZDerivation (zsubst d0 a (numeral n))`. `ZDerivation_zsubst`
  (`Zsubst.lean:834`) needs `d₀ ≤ a` (fresh large slot) — FALSE for an eigenvar. Generalize its
  hypothesis from `d ≤ a` to "`a` avoids every nested eigenvariable of `d`" (the only use of `d≤a` is
  deriving `e ≠ a` per nested I∀, `Zsubst.lean:852`); discharge via O1 (distinct eigenvariables).
- The CONCLUSION-TRACKING (`fstIdx (zsubst d0 a (num n)) = tpReduce (tp d) (fstIdx d) n`) then follows
  from `fstIdx_zsubst` (needs only `ZDerivation d0`, `Zsubst.lean:504`) + O2a (succedent) + O2b
  (antecedent). So conclusion-tracking is PURE plumbing once O2a/O2b land.

**NEXT (route-B continuation, in dependency order):**
1. **O1 freshness FIRST** (it gates O2a/O2b/O2c): add `a ∉ FV(seqAnt s) ∧ a ∉ FV(p)` to `zIallWff`
   (and the analogue to `zIndWff`). Blast radius = every `zIall`/`zInd` builder. Then O2a (Foundation
   formula lemma), O2b (per-element `fvSubstSeq` freshness), O2c (generalize `ZDerivation_zsubst`).
2. **O1** (freshness in `zIallWff`/`zIndWff`) — needed for non-empty `Γ`; deferrable if the headline
   ⊥-orbit only reaches empty-`Γ` I∀ sub-derivations (verify via the recursion trace).
3. **Rewire `red`'s I∀/chain/Ind branches to emit `tpReduce (tp dᵢ) Π 0`** (5.2.2 `iRKr`→reduced
   conclusion; Ind→`Γ→F(k)`, `k`=val `t`).
4. **Thm 3.4(b) invariant** `ZDerivation (red d) ∧ fstIdx (red d) = tpReduce (tp d) (fstIdx d) 0` by
   `zDerivation_induction`; the `Rep` cases already done (`fstIdx_red_eq_tpReduce_of_Rep`).
5. Then `iord_descent_red` (ordinal side unaffected), `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty`, M2 bridge → headline.

## 📍 Lap 90 — `redSound` DECOMPOSED + faithfulness finding (`red` faithful only for `Rep`)

**Build 🟢 1325 jobs. Headline still `[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms).**
3 green commits: (1) `redSound` decomposed into `redSoundGen` skeleton + 2 Thm-3.4 residuals; (2) Ind
residual restated at `zKValidF` (criticality-free); (3) K-core dispatch split into 3 case-5 sub-residuals
with `red_zK_rep`/`red_zK_splice` recursion equations PROVED.

**⭐ MAJOR FINDING (read `ANALYSIS-2026-06-25-lap90-red-faithful-only-for-rep.md`):** the lap-89 tag-4
dispatch + the repo's `red` are **faithful to Buchholz `d[0]` ONLY for `Rep`-reducible chains**
(`tp(d) = isymRep`). Two gaps for non-`Rep` chains: (1) Buchholz 5.2.2 reduces the conclusion to
`tp(dᵢ)(Π,0) ≠ Π`, but `red`/`iRKr` keep `Π` (`fstIdx_iRK = fstIdx d`); (2) the selected minimal-permissible
premise `dᵢ` can be an I-rule/axiom (`iperm` admits `isymR`/`isymLk`), not just a chain, so the
critical-sub-dispatch is ill-typed. ⟹ **`redSoundGen` (∀ ZDerivation) is FALSE**; the K-branch residuals
`ZDerivation_red_zK_replace/_splice` are FALSE as stated (flagged ⚠ in docstrings). **Saving grace —
Buchholz Cor 2.1:** on the ⊥-orbit (`ZDerivesEmpty`, Π = `→⊥`) every selected premise is `Rep`, so
`red = d[0]` faithfully THERE. The TRUE target is `redSound` over `ZDerivesEmpty`.

**⛔ ROUTE A REFUTED (lap 90, later — see analysis doc §UPDATE).** Concrete kill: `red` of a `∅→⊥`
chain recurses into `red d₀` where `d₀` (the selected `Rep` premise) derives `∅→A₀` (threading forces
`Γ₀=∅`, but succedent `A₀ ≠ ⊥`). For `∅→A₀`, `iperm` admits an I-rule premise (`isymR A₀`), so `red d₀`
mis-keeps the conclusion → invalid. The ⊥-condition is NOT preserved one level down, so no ⊥-orbit
invariant closes the recursion. `tp_isymRep_of_emptyAnt_botSucc` (proved) saves only the TOP step.

**NEXT (resume point) — ROUTE B: faithfully port Def 3.2 with conclusion reduction `tp(dᵢ)(Π,n)`:**
1. **Define `tpReduce I Π n` = Buchholz `I(Π,n)`** (the reduced conclusion): `R_∀xF → Γ→F(n)`,
   `R_¬A → …`, `L^k_A → ` left-reduction, `Rep → Π` (identity). Σ₁-definable.
2. **Re-point the reduct's conclusion**: chain branches build `zK (tpReduce (tp dᵢ) Π 0) …` instead of
   keeping `Π`; `iRKr`/the I-rule reducts get the reduced conclusion.
3. **Invariant = Buchholz Thm 3.4(b) verbatim**: `∀ d, ZDerivation d → ZDerivation (red d) ∧
   fstIdx (red d) = tpReduce (tp d) (fstIdx d) 0` — provable by PLAIN structural induction (no orbit
   restriction). Specialise to headline at `tp d = Rep` (⊥-orbit: `tpReduce Rep Π 0 = Π`).
4. **I-rule conclusion-tracking**: `red (zIall) = d0` omits Buchholz's `a/n` substitution `d₀(a/n)`;
   under route B it should derive `Γ→F(0)`. Use `Zsubst.lean` eigen-subst machinery (laps 72–76).
5. **REUSABLE (become route-B's `tp(dᵢ)=Rep` branch):** `red_zK_rep`/`red_zK_splice`,
   `tp_eq_isymRep_of_zTag`, `red_rep_of_tp_isymRep`, `zTag_not_iAx_of_tp_isymRep`,
   `ZDerivation_red_zK_replace` (5.2.2 validity under `tp dᵢ=Rep`), `tp_isymRep_of_emptyAnt_botSucc`.
6. **Independent tractable thread:** `zKValidF_iIndReduct_of_zInd` (Ind reduct validity, unaffected).

## 📍 Lap 89 (FRESH-MIND REVIEW) — endgame SINGLE-FRONT + tag-4 dispatch `iRK` DEFINED

**Build 🟢 1325 jobs, headline `[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms).**

**⭐ REVIEW FINDING the lap-88 handoff missed:** `PA_delta1Definable` is **discharged UPSTREAM** —
Foundation now proves `𝗣𝗔.Δ₁` as a real `noncomputable instance` (`InductionSchemeDelta1.lean:1379`),
so `peano_not_proves_consistency = [propext, choice, Quot.sound]` (axiom-clean). The whole lap-74/78/81
second-front campaign (`src/PADelta1.lean`) is moot. **The headline has exactly ONE open blocker:**
`goodstein_implies_consistency` (`Reduction.lean:68`) = crux-1 (done lap 57) ∘ crux-2 = `redSound`.
STATUS.md refreshed; memory `pa-delta1-discharged-upstream` written.

**LANDED this lap (3 green commits, all axiom-clean, all in `InternalZ.lean`):**
- ✅ **`permIdxDef`/`permIdx_defined`** — the dispatch index `permIdx` is now Σ₁-definable (was missing).
- ✅ **`iRKr`** (5.2.2 replace) = `iCritAux d (permIdx d) (znth s dᵢ)` + def. ⭐ key insight: the genuine
  reduct halves come from the **recursive table lookup `red dᵢ = znth s dᵢ`**, NOT `inference_critical_pair`
  — so each branch is a CLOSED definable term, no existential.
- ✅ **`iRKs`** (5.2.1 splice) = `zK (fstIdx d) r' (seqInsert (zKseq d) i dᵢ{0} dᵢ{1})`, halves
  `= znth (zKseq (znth s dᵢ)) {0,1}`, **rank `r' = max(irk(seqSucc(fstIdx dᵢ{0})), zKrank d)`** — VERIFIED
  to be exactly the minimal `r'` `isChainInf_seqInsert` requires (`irk(seqSucc(fstIdx a)) ≤ r' ∧ r ≤ r'`).
- ✅ **`iRKc`** (5.1 critical) — standalone extraction of the original tag-4 `iRcritG` branch.
- ✅ **`iRK`** (the dispatch) — 3-way, branching on the **Δ₀ sentinel `permIdx d < lh (zKseq d)`** (=
  criticality, via `permIdxAux_eq_self_of_none`/`_isPermPrem_of_lt`) rather than embedding Δ₁ `zKCriticalDef`;
  sub-dispatch on the same test for the selected premise. `iRK_defined` via nested `by_cases`.

**NEXT (resume point):**
1. **Rewire `iRNextG` tag-4 → `iRK d s`** (`InternalZ.lean:~6011`). Change `iRNextG`'s tag-4 from the inline
   `iRcritG d (…)` to `iRK d s`; replace the tag-4 block in `iRNextGDef` with `!iRKDef y d s`; the
   `iRNextG_defined` proof simplifies (tag-4 case = `!iRKDef`). ⚠ Blast radius: `red_zK` and the lap-86
   `not_zKCritical_*` lemmas (now apply only to the 5.1 sub-case where `permIdx d = lh`). Recheck `red_zK`
   and the descent-bridge lemmas after the rewire.
2. **Semantic dispatch equivalences for `redSound`**: `permIdx d = lh (zKseq d) ↔ zKCritical (fstIdx d)
   (zKseq d)` (both directions banked at `permIdxAux` level) — wire as named lemmas so `redSound`'s tag-4
   case knows which Buchholz branch fired.
3. **`redSound`** = `zDerivation_induction`, tag-4 split via the sentinel into 5.1 (`ZDerivation_iRcritG_of`),
   5.2.1 (`ZDerivation_seqInsert_of_zK` — supply genuine halves from the critical premise's
   `inference_critical_pair`; discharge `isChainInf_seqInsert`'s end-sequent hyps + `r' ≤ dg(parent)` i.e.
   `rk(A(dᵢ)) ≤ dg(parent)`), 5.2.2 (`ZDerivation_iCritAux_of_zK`); then `iord_descent_red` UNCONDITIONAL
   → `iord_red_iterate_descends` → `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` (`Crux2Blueprint`) → `Reduction.lean:68`.

## 📍 Lap 88 — 5.2.1 GENUINE-OBJECT stack complete (descent + ZDerivation) + 5.2 dispatch index

**Build 🟢 1325 jobs, axiom base clean. 5 green commits.** All new lemmas in `InternalZ.lean`,
`[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`.

**LANDED:**
- ✅ **`iord_descent_seqInsert`** (+ `_of_ZDerivation`/`_of_iSpliceDescent`) — ordinal descent DIRECTLY on
  the genuine `seqInsert` object via rotation kernel `icmp_iseqNaddIdg_seqInsert` (J-shifted induction,
  `isNF` carried; base = F2; suffix folds via `inadd_right_mono`). **No `inadd_assoc`/permutation needed**
  — the lap-87 "needs an `iseqNaddIdg`-reindex" worry was avoidable. + `idg`-side
  `iseqMaxIdg_seqInsert_le`/`idg_seqInsert_le` + `iseqMaxIdgAux_le_of_all`.
- ✅ **`ZDerivation_seqInsert_of`** / `_of_zK` — 5.2.1 validity: spliced chain is a genuine `ZDerivation`
  (analogue of `ZDerivation_iCritAux_of`). + reusable `forall_znth_seqInsert`.
- ✅ **`permIdxAux`/`permIdx`** — 5.2 dispatch index = least permissible premise `i` (`iperm (tp dᵢ) s`);
  full spec stack + Σ₁-def + `permIdx_lt_of_not_zKCritical`.

**⟹ all three dispatch branches (5.1/5.2.1/5.2.2) now object-complete + co-located validity+descent.**

**NEXT (the assembly — not new math; see HANDOFF-lap88 ▶ NEXT):**
1. **Rewrite `iRNextG` tag-4 to DISPATCH** (zKCritical → 5.1; else `permIdx` → sub-dispatch 5.2.1/5.2.2).
   Large blast radius (`iRNextGDef`, `iRNextG_defined`, `red_zK`, `not_zKCritical_*`). Consider a separate
   definable `iRNextGD` to contain it, then swap `redTable`.
2. **Wire genuine halves** `a=dᵢ{0}, b=dᵢ{1}` from `inference_critical_pair` on the critical premise;
   discharge `isChainInf_seqInsert` end-sequent hyps + build `iSpliceDescent`.
3. **`redSound`** via `zDerivation_induction`, tag-4 split → each ZDerivation constructor; then
   `iord_descent_red` unconditional → `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` → headline.

## 📍 Lap 87 — 5.2.1 splice VALIDITY object is ordered insert-at-`i`, NOT the banked end-append model

**Build 🟢 1325 jobs, axiom base clean (headline 0 math axioms).** See
`ANALYSIS-2026-06-25-lap87-splice-order-sensitivity.md`.

**LANDED (axiom-clean `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`, `InternalZ.lean` after `zKValidF_seqUpdate`):**
splice end-sequent read-outs (`chainAsucc`/`chainAnt`_{`seqCons_seqUpdate_{top,lt}`,`seqUpdate_{self,of_ne}`});
`isChainInf_iSpliceEnd` + `zKValidF_iSpliceEnd` — the order-independent validity REDUCTIONS (take threading
as hypotheses; reusable as the ordinal-side interface + `forall`-premise template).

**FINDING (confirmed vs Buchholz Def 3.2, paper md line 75–76):** the banked ordinal-descent splice model
`seqCons (seqUpdate ds i a) b` (half `a` in place at `i`, half `b` appended at the END) serves the ordinal
`õ` (= order-independent `#`-fold) but is WRONG for `isChainInf` validity, which threads each antecedent
only to STRICTLY-EARLIER succedents. The genuine reduct `K^{r'}_Π(i/dᵢ{0},dᵢ{1})` is the ORDERED
in-place splice `d₀…d_{i−1} dᵢ{0} dᵢ{1} d_{i+1}…dₗ` (insert two halves at `i`, shift tail). So
`zKValidF_iSpliceEnd`'s `isChainInf` hypothesis is generically unsatisfiable for the genuine halves — it's
the ordinal packaging, not the validity object.

**DONE (lap 87, abstract-spec form, axiom-clean, `InternalZ.lean` after `zKValidF_iSpliceEnd`):**
- ✅ **`isChainInf_seqInsert_spec`** — THE hard 5.2.1 threading math. The spliced chain
  `cs = d₀…d_{i−1} a b d_{i+1}…dₗ` is `isChainInf s r' cs` from the original chain's unpacked validity at
  its distinguished `j₀` (`i ≤ j₀`) + the Thm-3.4(a) genuine half end-sequents. New distinguished `j₀+1`;
  full order-sensitive threading by region (worked out + machine-checked).
- ✅ **`zKValidF_seqInsert_spec`** — full faithful validity from the `isChainInf` core + per-half
  well-formedness, via the `forall`-premise `key` over the four insert regions.
Both take the insert read-outs `hpre`/`hai`/`hbi`/`hsuf` as hypotheses (abstract spec).

**DONE (lap 87, concrete op, axiom-clean):**
- ✅ **`seqInsertAux`/`seqInsert`** (`PR.Construction`, `𝚺₁-Function₅`, mirror `seqUpdateAux`) +
  read-outs `seqInsert_lh`, `znth_seqInsert_{pre,at,at1,suf}` (ite-free). NB: `Function₅` Definable
  instance via the explicit `(Γ-[m+1]).DefinableFunction₅` dot form (Foundation lacks bare
  `Γ-Function₅` notation).
- ✅ **`isChainInf_seqInsert`** / **`zKValidF_seqInsert`** — the specs instantiated on the concrete
  `seqInsert` (read-out hyps discharged, given `i < lh ds`). The genuine 5.2.1 reduct's chain-validity +
  faithful validity are now usable object-level facts.

**NEXT (remaining 5.2.1 — connect to the descent + the `red` dispatch):**
2. **Descent transfer**: `õ(seqInsert ds i a b) = õ(seqCons (seqUpdate ds i a) b)` (same `#`-multiset,
   `iseqNaddIdg` permutation-invariant) ⟹ inherit banked `iord_descent_iSpliceEnd`. (Or direct `iord`
   descent on the insert object mirroring `iotil_iSpliceEnd_lt`.)
3. **Wire the genuine halves**: supply `a = dᵢ{0}`, `b = dᵢ{1}` from `inference_critical_pair` applied to
   the critical premise `dᵢ` (the redex finder, L3.1) + the Thm-3.4(a) end-sequent facts to discharge
   `ha_ant`/`ha_rank`/`hb_succ`/`hb_ant`. Then `red`'s tag-4 5.2.1 branch + its `redSound` case.

---

## 📍 Lap 86 (FRESH-MIND REVIEW) — gating criticality question RESOLVED: `red` needs the 5.2 dispatch

**Build 🟢 1325 jobs, axiom base clean. Headline `peano_not_proves_goodstein = [propext, sorryAx,
choice, Quot.sound]` (0 math axioms, honest sorry).** Resolved the lap-85 NEXT-priority-2 gating
question (`ANALYSIS-2026-06-25-lap86-criticality-resolved.md`).

**FINDING (in-kernel, axiom-clean):** a `ZDerivesEmpty` K-chain is NOT always critical. The critical-only
reduct `red (zK s r ds) = iRcritG …` is **itself non-critical** — its `⊥`-half premise (index 1) is a
`K`-chain (`tp = isymRep`, permissible everywhere). New lemmas in `InternalZ.lean` (after `red_zK`):
`not_zKCritical_iCritReductG` / `not_zKCritical_iRcritG` / `not_zKCritical_red_zK`. ⟹ The
iterate-descent's `zKCritical` hypothesis (`iord_iR2_iterate_descends`'s `hcrit`) is **unsatisfiable
after one step**. So the critical-only `red`/`iR2` (Buchholz Def 3.2 case **5.1 only**) cannot drive the
descent; the genuine `red` MUST dispatch the **5.2** cases too.

**Two corrections to the lap-85 plan:**
- Lap-85 priority-1 (`iord (red x) = iord (iR2 x)` unconditional) is necessary but **NOT sufficient** —
  it inherits `iR2`'s descent, which is itself gated on the now-false criticality. Don't close
  `iord_descent_red` via it alone.
- `red`'s tag-4 must DISPATCH 5.1 / 5.2.1 / 5.2.2 (not always `iRcritG`).

**NEXT (the corrected `red` — 5.2 dispatch; descent for each is BANKED, lap-82):**
1. **Decidability — DONE (lap 86):** `zKCritical` is now Δ₁ (`zKCriticalDef` + `zKCritical_defined`/
   `_definable`, axiom-clean, in `InternalZ.lean` after `zKValidF_of_zKValid`). `iRNextG`'s tag-4 can now
   branch on `zKCritical (fstIdx d) (zKseq d)` and stay Σ₁. ⚠ Still to reconcile: `∀ i < lh ds` (repo)
   vs Buchholz's `∀ i ≤ j₀` — the `j₀`-restricted form is the faithful branch; decide whether the
   stronger `∀ i < lh ds` mis-classifies any Buchholz-critical chain (if some i > j₀ has tp(dᵢ) ◁ Π).
2. **5.2.1 splice** — `red d = zK s r' (seqCons (seqUpdate ds i dᵢ{1}) dᵢ{0})`. Descent banked
   (`iord_descent_iSpliceEnd`). ⚠ **The VALIDITY is the next hard piece**: only read-outs are banked
   (`znth_seqCons_seqUpdate_top`/`_lt`, `lh_seqCons_seqUpdate`) — NO `isChainInf`/`zKValidF` for the
   spliced shape yet. Needs the spliced-chain threading proof (the new chain re-establishes `isChainInf`:
   `j₀`, `Γᵢ ⊆ Γ,A₀…` threading with the two spliced halves, rank `≤ r'`). Required because for a CRITICAL
   `dᵢ` the pre-ordinal `õ(red dᵢ)` BLOWS UP (Lemma 4.1(b)), so 5.2.2-replace cannot be used (its descent
   needs `õ(v) ≺ õ(dᵢ)`) — the splice incorporates `dᵢ`'s halves (smaller `õ`) directly.
3. **5.2.2 replace — VALIDITY DONE (lap 86):** `ZDerivation_iCritAux_of` (axiom-clean, next to
   `iord_descent_iCritAux_of_ZDerivation`): replacing premise `i` of a valid chain by a same-end-sequent
   reduct `v` that is a `ZDerivation` (+ its own well-formedness) gives `ZDerivation (iCritAux …)`. With
   the banked descent, the 5.2.2 leaf is complete at the lemma level — both invariants take the same N1
   IH on `v = red dᵢ`. For ⊥-chains the chosen premise is a `Rep`-chain so `tp(dᵢ)(Π,n)=Π` (conclusion
   unchanged) and `v`'s well-formedness hyps are automatic (`tp = isymRep`, I/Ax conjuncts vacuous) — a
   specialized tag-4 corollary collapses them. STILL TODO: the general 5.2.2 conclusion op `tp(dᵢ)(s,n)`
   for the non-⊥ / non-Rep sub-case (only needed if `red` is defined on all d, not just ⊥-chains).
4. **`redSound`** = `zDerivation_induction`, tag-4 split 5.1/5.2.1/5.2.2 → `zKValidF` chain;
   `iord_descent_red` becomes UNCONDITIONAL. (R2 / `zAx1` tag-7 from lap-85 still apply to the 5.1 case.)

## 📍 Lap 85 — R1 DISCHARGED + M1a `red` DEFINED + M1b ordinal bridge (5 green commits)

**Build 🟢 1325 jobs, axiom base clean ([propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]).** The keystone
re-point landed and the genuine reduct now exists.

DONE this lap:
- **R1 (the `ZPhi` re-point)** — `ZPhi`'s `zK` disjunct now carries `zKValidF` (faithful, criticality-free
  validity). `zDerivation_zK_intro` is a theorem (was `hZPhiK`). `ZDerivation_iCritReductG_of`/
  `ZDerivation_iRcritG_of` drop the re-point residual. `zKValidF_of_ZDerivation_zK` replaces
  `zKValid_of_ZDerivation_zK`. Dead iR2-orbit descent now takes an explicit `zKCritical` hyp (honest).
- **M1a — `red` DEFINED** (`InternalZ`): `iRNextG` (5-case dispatch, K-case = `iRcritG` on correct reduced
  endsequents), `redTable` PR-recursion, `red := znth (redTable d) d`, 𝚺₁-definable (`redDef`). Per-rule
  recursion eqs `red_zAtom/zIall/zIneg/zInd/zAxAll/zAxNeg/red_zK`. `fstIdx_red_of_tag_Ind_or_K`. Genuine
  endsequent ops definable (`seqSetSuccDef`/`seqAddAntDef`). Blueprint `red`/`fstIdx_red` wired to reals
  (blueprint sorries 6→4).
- **M1b ordinal bridge** — `iord_iRcritG_eq_iRcrit` (via `iotil_zK`/`idg_zK` conclusion-independence). The
  ordinal descent on `red`'s K-case = the banked `iRcrit` descent.

NEXT (M1b `redSound`, the cut-elim nut — priority):
1. **R2 (auxiliary IH)** — discharge the `haux0`/`haux1` hyps of `ZDerivation_iRcritG_of`: the two
   auxiliaries `zK (seqSetSucc (fstIdx d) A(d)) r (seqUpdate ds i (ρ i))` etc. are `ZDerivation`s. Needs:
   (a) premises are ZDerivations — unchanged ones from `d`'s ZDerivation; the replaced one `ρ i =
   zAxReduct (red (znth ds i))` by the `redSound` IH + **`ZDerivation_zAxReduct`** (see ⚠ below);
   (b) the aux chain is `zKValidF` — the banked `zKValidF_iCritReductSeq`/`isChainInf_iCritReductSeq`
   threading (Thm 3.4(a)), establishing the recombination from `d`'s validity + criticality.
2. ⚠ **`zAx1` is TAG 7, NOT a `ZPhi` rule** (tags 0–6). So `zAxReduct` of an axiom premise (tag 5/6 →
   `zAx1`) is currently NOT a `ZDerivation`. Resolve before R2: either (i) the redex premises are never
   tag-5/6 axioms (so `zAxReduct` = identity there — likely, the redex i-premise has `tp = isymR` ⟹ I-rule
   tag 1/2 via `tp_isymR_tag`; the j-premise `tp = isymLk` — CHECK if that forces an L-rule vs an axiom),
   OR (ii) add a tag-7 disjunct to `ZPhi` for `zAx1` (the atomic identity axiom) and re-bless the Fixpoint.
3. **`redSound`** = `zDerivation_induction` over `d`; tags 1,2 (I-rules, but never on ⊥) reuse
   `ZDerivation_iR2_zIall/zIneg` (red=iR2 there); tag 3 (Ind) needs the Ind-reduct `zKValidF` (deep
   residual, parallels old `ZDerivation_iR2_zInd_of_zKValid` but only `zKValidF` now); tag 4 = `ZDerivation_iRcritG_of` + R2.
4. **`iord_descent_red`** — provable on CRITICAL chains: `red_zK` + `iord_iRcritG_eq_iRcrit` + banked
   `iord_descent_iRcrit_of_chain`. ⚠ **GAP: `red` is critical-case-only** (tag-4 always `iRcritG` at
   `redexCode`). Non-critical chains (no redex pair found) need Buchholz 5.2 splice/replace dispatch —
   `red` must branch on `zKCritical`. Decide: does a ZDerivesEmpty chain always have a critical redex
   (positive rank ⟹ L3.1 redex pair)? If yes, critical-only `red` suffices and `iord_descent_red` closes.

## 📍 Lap 84 (FINAL) — RedSound CRITICAL case reduced to TWO named residuals (12 green commits)

**Build 🟢 green, axiom base untouched.** The genuine critical reduct is now named and its validity
isolated. Banked beyond the D₁ interface below:
- `iCritReductG s C rOut rIn0 rIn1 ds0 ds1` — the GENUINE critical reduct
  `K^{rOut}_Π ⟨K^{rIn0}_{Θ→A(d)} ds0, K^{rIn1}_{A(d),Θ→D} ds1⟩`, auxiliaries carrying the real Thm-3.4(a)
  endsequents (`seqSetSucc s C` / `seqAddAnt C s`). Read-outs `fstIdx`/`zTag`/`zKseq`.
- `zKValidF_iCritReductGen` — its outer-chain D₁ validity, **threading AUTOMATIC** from the genuine
  sequent ops (only needs `irk C ≤ rOut` + formula-hood).
- `ZDerivation_iCritReductG_of` — `iCritReductG` is a `ZDerivation` **modulo exactly two residuals**:
  - **(R1) the re-point** `hZPhiK : Seq ds → (∀i<lh, ZDerivation(znth ds i)) → zKValidF s r ds →
    ZDerivation (zK s r ds)` — i.e. `ZPhi`'s `zK` disjunct `zKValid → zKValidF`. ⚠️ INTERLOCKED with the
    descent: `zDerivation_zK_inv` then yields only `zKValidF` (no criticality), breaking
    `iord_descent_iR2_zK_of_valid` (which uses criticality to FIND the redex via
    `inference_critical_pair_of_chain`). So the re-point MUST land together with a descent that dispatches
    criticality as a SEPARATE fact (supply `zKCritical` at the reduction site, where Buchholz case-5
    establishes it — `zKValid_iff_zKValidF_and_zKCritical` is the bridge). Do this as a FOCUSED turn.
  - **(R2) auxiliary IH** — the two auxiliaries are `ZDerivation`s of `Θ→A(d)` / `A(d),Θ→D` (recursive
    Thm 3.4(a)). Needs: extract `A(d)` from the redex (`A_i = chainAsucc ds i`; `A_i = ^∀ p ⟹ A(d) =
    substs1 (num k) p`, `A_i = inegF q ⟹ A(d) = q`) + prove d{0}'s isChainInf with distinguished premise
    `j0' = i` (the replaced premise `dᵢ[k]` carries succedent `A(d)`), threading = original ≤i threading.
    rank drop `irk(A(d)) < irk(A_i) ≤ r` is BANKED (`irk_cut_lt_rank_forall`/`_neg`).

**Recommended next sequencing:** R2 first (independent of re-point, pure Thm-3.4(a) structural content),
then the focused R1 re-point+dispatch turn. Non-critical (5.2.2) is already done (`zKValidF_seqUpdate_iR2`);
splice (5.2.1) prereqs banked. After R1+R2 the critical case closes ⟹ assemble the 5-case `red` +
RedSound structural induction (D₁ ∥ banked D₃).

## 📍 Lap 84 (continued) — D₁ VALIDITY INTERFACE complete for all 3 reduct cases (9 green commits)

**Build 🟢 green, axiom base untouched.** Beyond the 3 preservation lemmas below, banked (all in
`InternalZ.lean`, kernel-checked):
- **Critical (5.1) D₁ — COMPLETE as a hypothesis interface.** `isChainInf_iCritReductSeq` (the 2-element
  recombination chain `⟨d{0},d{1}⟩` is `isChainInf`-valid given Thm 3.4(a) cut-threading) → lifted to full
  `zKValidF_iCritReductSeq` (auxiliaries are `Rep`-chains ⟹ own-perm auto, I/Ax conjuncts vacuous;
  threading + formula-hood supplied). Helpers `znth_iCritReductSeq_one`, `forall_lt_iCritReductSeq`.
  ⭐ **VERIFIED FAITHFUL to Buchholz §2 p.6 / Thm 3.4(a):** `d{0}⊢Θ→A(d)`, `d{1}⊢A(d),Θ→D`, the cut on
  `A(d)`; my hyps `hsucc1`/`hthread0`/`hthread1`/`hrank0` map exactly (hthread1's `B=seqSucc(fstIdx d0)`
  disjunct IS the cut formula `A(d)`).
- **General congruence** `isChainInf_congr` (validity reads `ds` only through `lh`+`chainAsucc`/`chainAnt`).
- **Splice (5.2.1) prereqs**: read-outs `znth_seqCons_seqUpdate_top`/`_lt`, `lh_seqCons_seqUpdate`.
- **Genuine-reduct sequent ops** (replace the ordinal-shadow `iCritAux`'s reuse of `fstIdx d`):
  `seqSetSucc s C` (= `Θ→C`), `seqAddAnt A s` (= `A,Θ→D`), with `inAnt_seqCons`/`inAnt_seqAddAnt`.

**NEXT (genuine reduct, the remaining M1 core — STARTED):** define the genuine critical auxiliaries
`d{0} = zK (seqSetSucc s (A(d))) r (seqUpdate ds i (reduct dᵢ))`, `d{1} = zK (seqAddAnt (A(d)) s) r
(seqUpdate ds j (reduct dⱼ))` — i.e. like `iCritAux` BUT with the correct conclusion sequents from the
new ops. Then `A(d)` is read from the redex via `inference_critical_pair` (∀xF case: `A(d)=F(k)`;
¬A case: `A(d)=A`); prove the auxiliaries derive those sequents (Thm 3.4(a), structural IH) so
`zKValidF_iCritReductSeq`'s hyps are MET. Then re-point `ZPhi` zK disjunct `zKValid→zKValidF` (~6 sites,
`zKValidFDef` banked) and run the D₁/D₃ structural induction = `RedSound`. M1 checkpoint per
`E-CRUX2-ROADMAP`: validity proved IN the same induction as the (banked) descent.

## 📍 Lap 84 — RedSound validity-preservation toolkit BANKED (3 green commits) + judge's parallel-induction unlock

**Build 🟢 green (1324 jobs), axiom base untouched.** Three reusable `RedSound` building blocks landed in
`InternalZ.lean` (the `E-CRUX2 §8` T2/T3 "replace-a-premise stays a valid K^r chain" leaf), right after
the `seqUpdate` read-outs and after `fstIdx_iR2_of_tag_Ind_or_K`:
- `isChainInf_seqUpdate` — chain-validity (`isChainInf`: j₀/threading/rank) is INVARIANT under replacing
  premise `i` by a same-end-sequent reduct `v` (`fstIdx v = fstIdx (znth ds i)`). Helpers:
  `fstIdx_znth_seqUpdate`, `chainAsucc_seqUpdate`, `chainAnt_seqUpdate`.
- `zKValidF_seqUpdate` — full faithful-validity preservation, taking `v`'s own well-formedness
  (own-perm `iperm (tp v)(fstIdx v)` = Lemma 3.3; tag-gated I/Ax formula-hood) as hypotheses.
- `zKValidF_seqUpdate_iR2` — CONCRETE non-critical case (Buchholz 5.2.2): when premise `i` is itself
  `Ind`/`K`-tagged, its `iR2`-reduct is a `Rep`-tagged chain (`iR2_eq_zK_of_tag_Ind_or_K`,
  `zTag_iR2_…=4`, `tp_iR2_…=isymRep`), so own-perm is automatic (`iperm_isymRep`) and the I/Ax
  conjuncts are vacuous; end-sequent invariance from `fstIdx_iR2_of_tag_Ind_or_K`. ⟹ `zKValidF` preserved.

⭐ **JUDGE UNLOCK (Buchholz both papers, validate-don't-trust):** validity is a **PARALLEL invariant**,
NOT post-hoc recovery. Buchholz proves validity (Thm 3.4 / Thm 6.2 = our `zKValidF`/D₁) and
ordinal-descent (Lemma 4.1/4.2 = our banked `iord_descent_*` / D₃) as TWO SIMULTANEOUS inductions over
the SAME primrec reduct `red` (Def 3.2 / Beweistheorie Thm 6.6 — 5-case tag dispatch; only search =
Lemma 3.1 least redex pair = our `inference_critical_pair`). `RedSound`-on-`iR2` was false ONLY because
`iR2` was built ordinal-first. BUILD `red` (the dispatch) and prove its validity IN the same recursion
that gives descent. §7 D₁=`∀n d[n]⊢tp(d)(Π,n)` (=RedSound), D₃=descent — the spec. Sources:
`papers/buchholz-beweistheorie-lecture-notes.md` (red/Thm 6.2), `papers/buchholz-on-gentzens-first-consistency-proof.md`
(Def 3.2 / §7 D₁–D₃). Fallback ONLY if critical case can't be zKValidF-faithful: Siders' Howard vector
(`papers/siders-gentzen-consistency-proofs-arithmetic.md`) — HA/intuitionistic redesign, exhaust Buchholz first.

**NEXT (resume here):** (a) the SUB-CRITICAL splice (Buchholz 5.2.1) validity-preservation analog
`zKValidF_seqSplice` over `seqCons (seqUpdate ds j a) b` — harder (lh+1, threading shift), pairs with banked
`iord_descent_iSpliceEnd`. (b) the CRITICAL case (5.1): `iCritReduct = zK (fstIdx d)(r-1) ⟨d{0},d{1}⟩` —
its two auxiliaries `d{ν}=iCritAux` are `seqUpdate`-replacements, so `zKValidF_seqUpdate_iR2` gives each
auxiliary's validity; the OUTER rank-(r-1) chain validity needs the recombination threading (Thm 3.4(a),
`rk(A(d))<r` already banked as `irk_cut_lt_rank_*`). (c) Re-point `ZPhi`'s zK disjunct `zKValid`→`zKValidF`
(blast radius measured lap-82: ~6 sites; `zKValidFDef` banked) and quantify RedSound + descent over `red`.


## 📍 Lap 83 fresh-mind REFINEMENT (read before executing the lap-82 re-point) — "descent = just wiring" is OVERSTATED

Re-read `iord_descent_iR2_zK_of_valid` (`InternalZ.lean:4755`) end-to-end. The lap-82 KEY FINDING
("step 2 is not new descent math, only wire the banked `iord_descent_iCritAux`/`_iSpliceEnd` into a
dispatch") is **too optimistic on one point**: the K-descent does NOT merely *consume* criticality as a
side fact — it uses `hnperm` (criticality) to **FIND THE REDEX** via `inference_critical_pair_of_chain`,
and then `rw [iR2_zK_eq_iRcrit]` to make `iR2` BE that critical reduct. So:

- In the **non-critical** case there is provably **no such redex** (some premise `i ≤ j₀` has
  `iperm (tp dᵢ) s`), so `inference_critical_pair_of_chain` is inapplicable AND `iRcrit` (= the current
  `iR2_zK`) reduces nothing useful. The banked `iord_descent_iCritAux` descends the reduct
  `zK s r (seqUpdate ds i v)` — but **only if `iR2_zK` actually PRODUCES that reduct**, which it does
  not: `iR2_zK_eq_iRcrit` is unconditional. Wiring the banked descent therefore REQUIRES the reduct
  function `iR2_zK` itself to branch on `zKCritical s ds` (critical → `iRcrit`; non-critical → `iCritAux`
  replace; sub-critical → `iSpliceEnd` splice). That is a **definitional change to the reduct**, not a
  proof-only dispatch — and it breaks `iR2_zK_eq_iRcrit` and everything proved through it (`iR2_zK`,
  the redex-finder route in `iord_descent_iR2_zK_of_valid`, plus the §5 `zAxReduct` bundles which assume
  the iRcrit shape). The lap-82 plan's own step-3 escape hatch ("if `iR2` can't be made to dispatch case
  5.2, define a NEW reduct and re-point `RedSound` + descent onto it") is the realistic route.

- **Net:** the re-point of `ZPhi` → `zKValidF` (step 1) cannot stay green by itself — it forces
  `iord_descent_iR2_zK_of_valid` to take only `zKValidF`, whose non-critical case has no banked
  *producer*. Recommended lap-83 sequencing: **(a)** first build the non-critical reduct + its descent
  capstone as a STANDALONE green lemma `iord_descent_iCritAux_zK_noncrit` (hypotheses: `zKValidF` +
  `¬zKCritical` + the witnessing `i`), reusing banked `iord_descent_iCritAux`; **(b)** likewise the
  sub-critical splice capstone; **(c)** ONLY THEN define the dispatching reduct (new `iR2'` or a guarded
  `iR2_zK`) and re-point — so each step lands green and committable rather than a red all-or-nothing swap.
  This keeps "hardest-first" honest: the genuinely-new math is the non-critical/sub-critical *producers*
  (selecting the witness `i` / splice point from `isChainInf` + ¬criticality), then `RedSound` validity.

## ⭐⭐ Lap 82 (OPERATOR REDIRECT) — crux-2 unblocked: criticality ≠ chain-validity

**Build 🟢 green.** Operator moved Front 2 (`PA_delta1Definable`) to a parallel box — it's a tracked
rest-point; STOP touching `PADelta1.lean` (it merges later). Drive **crux 2 (`RedSound`)** only.
(Lap-82 also banked 3 axiom-clean `PADelta1.lean` code-size bounds before the redirect: `lt_qqAll`,
`self_le_qqAllItr`, `count_le_qqAllItr` — harmless, stay.)

**ROOT CAUSE found + validated against Buchholz (both papers).** `zKValid` bakes a spurious *criticality*
conjunct `(∀ i < lh ds, ¬ iperm (tp (znth ds i)) s)` into chain-validity. Buchholz's `K^r` validity
(§3 clause 5 = `isChainInf`: j₀ + threading + rank) carries NO criticality; criticality is a *reduction*
property (Def 3.2 case 5), not a validity one. Baking it in → `ZDerivation` = only-critical chains →
the genuine reduct's `Rep`-tagged recombined premises fail validity → `RedSound`-on-`iR2` false. See
`ANALYSIS-2026-06-25-lap82-criticality-not-validity.md`.

DONE this lap (axiom-clean, `InternalZ.lean` after `zKValid_definable`):
- `zKCritical s ds` (decoupled criticality), `zKValidF s r ds` (faithful validity = `zKValid` − criticality),
  `zKValid_iff_zKValidF_and_zKCritical` (in-kernel: criticality IS a separable conjunct),
  `zKValidF_of_zKValid`.

⭐ **KEY FINDING (lap 82): DESCENT (D₃, Lemma 4.1/Thm 4.2) is ALREADY FULLY BANKED.** Every Buchholz
reduction case has its closed `iord_descent_*` proved (`InternalZ.lean` 2529–3293): I-rules, Ind (LH4),
non-critical chain `iord_descent_iCritAux` (5.2.2), splice `iord_descent_iSpliceEnd` (5.2.1), critical
`iord_descent_iRcrit_of_chain` (5.1). `iord_iR2_iterate_descends` assembles the ε₀-descent modulo
`RedSound`. So crux-2 is NOT blocked on descent — the wall is purely VALIDITY (RedSound) + the dispatch.

DONE this lap (continued): **`zKValidFDef` + `zKValidF_defined`/`_definable`** — the Δ₁ arithmetization
of `zKValidF` (= `zKValidDef` minus the `¬(!ipermDef ti s)` line), green first try. This is the
prerequisite for re-pointing `zblueprint`'s `zK` disjunct.

⭐ **MEASURED re-point blast radius (lap 82, empirically: re-pointed ZPhi, built, reverted).** Changing
`ZPhi` (`InternalZ.lean:3694`) + `zPhiBounded_iff` (3741, two `rintro`/`exact` spots 3754/3768) +
`zblueprint` (3790/3808: `zKValidDef.sigma/.pi` → `zKValidFDef.sigma/.pi`) + `zPhi_definable` proof.
Then exactly **6 lemma sites** break, all mechanical EXCEPT the descent capstone:
- `zKValid_of_ZDerivation_zK` (~4000): change return type → `zKValidF` (rename).
- forward constructors `ZDerivation_iR2_zInd_of_zKValid` (5094), `ZDerivation_iCritReduct_of` (5125):
  take `zKValidF` instead of `zKValid` (the genuine reduct validates against faithful validity — these
  become PROVABLE where they were vacuous before).
- ⚠️ **`iord_descent_iR2_zK_of_valid` (4780) — THE hard one**: currently UNCONDITIONAL because `zKValid`
  forced criticality (redex always found). With only `zKValidF`, must `by_cases zKCritical s ds`:
  critical → existing `iRcrit` route; non-critical → `iR2` must do the non-critical reduct
  (`iCritAux` replace, descent `iord_descent_iCritAux` BANKED) — needs the `iR2_zK` DISPATCH (step 2).

REDESIGN (revised — hardest-first; descent already done; arithmetization now ready):
1. Re-point `ZPhi`'s `zK` disjunct (`InternalZ.lean:3694`) `zKValid` → `zKValidF` (+ `zPhiBounded_iff` +
   `zblueprint` → `zKValidFDef` + `zPhi_definable`; blast radius measured above).
   `zKValid_iff_zKValidF_and_zKCritical` makes producers mechanical.
2. Make `iR2_zK` DISPATCH (currently always `iRcrit`, `iR2_zK_eq_iRcrit`): critical (5.1, redex exists)
   → `iRcrit`; non-critical (5.2.2, `∃ i ≤ j₀ tp(dᵢ) ◁ Π`) → `iCritAux` replace premise i by `iR2 dᵢ`;
   sub-critical (5.2.1) → splice. Descent for each is ALREADY banked — only wire the selection.
3. **Prove `RedSound` = Thm 3.4(b)/D₁** (THE new content): the reduct is a genuine `ZDerivation`
   (`zKValidF`), by the same `ZDerivation` induction that drives descent. Critical case: recombination
   `K^{r−1}_Π d{0} d{1}` valid via Thm 3.4(a) (`d{0} ⊢ Π·A(d)`, `d{1} ⊢ A(d),Π`, `rk(A(d)) < r`) — the
   `inference_critical_pair` redex + the `zDerivation_z*_inv` peeling primitives are in place. Non-critical:
   `isChainInf s' r (seqUpdate ds i (iR2 dᵢ))` for the reduced end-sequent `s' = tp(d)(Π,n)`.
Fallback: Siders' Howard vector (`papers/siders-gentzen-consistency-proofs-arithmetic.md`, cross-check only).

## ⭐ Lap 81 (FRESH-MIND REVIEW) — criticality crux `not_criticality_aux` PROVED (axiom-clean)

**Build 🟢 green (1324 jobs). Direction KEPT (Δ₁ thread is the actively-movable front; crux 2 stays
DEEP-REFLECTION-blocked).** This lap discharged the criticality crux — the math heart of the
`inductionSchemeUnivDelta1` mem_iff.

DONE (all axiom-clean `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`, `PADelta1.lean` §Recognizer):
- **`subst_eq_subst_of`** + `isUTermVec_qVec` — formula substitution congruence (`subst` of an
  `n`-ary semiformula depends only on the first `n` entries); via `pi1_structural_induction`.
- **`subst_fvarSeq_quote`** — `subst (fvarSeq k) ⌜F⌝ = ⌜F ⇜ (&·)⌝` (mirrors `subst_fvarSeq_fixitr`).
- **`fvar?_substs_lt`** — fv-free `k`-ary `F` ⟹ `(F ⇜ (&·)).FVar? x → x < k` (via `Semiformula.fvar?_rew`).
- **`freeVariables_eq_empty_of_shift`** — shift-fixpoint ⟹ fv-free (strong-induction descent on free vars).
- **`subst_fvarSeq_le` / `subst_fvarSeq_succ`** — `subst (fvarSeq m) F = subst (fvarSeq k) F` for
  `k ≤ m` / `m = k+1`; stated at GENERIC V to dodge the `V = ℕ` order diamond. ⚠️ KEY GOTCHA: V's `+`
  on `ℕ` IS native, but its `≤`/`-` are NOT (`instLE_foundation ≠ instLENat`); bundle order bounds at
  generic V (where `le_self_add` picks V's order), invoke at `V := ℕ` (then `+` is native, omega-friendly).
- **⭐ `not_criticality_aux`** — THE crux: `0 < ψ.fvSup → ¬(IsSemiformula ℒₒᵣ (ψ.fvSup-1)
  ⌜fixitr 0 ψ.fvSup ▹ ψ⌝ ∧ shift ⌜..⌝ = ⌜..⌝)`. Pins `m = fvSup` in the recognizer. Route:
  `IsSemiformula.sound` → F (m-1)-ary, ⌜F⌝=body; F fv-free; `subst (fvarSeq m)` both sides
  (`subst_fvarSeq_fixitr` rhs, `subst_fvarSeq_succ`+`subst_fvarSeq_quote` lhs) ⟹ `ψ = F⇜(&·)`,
  free vars <m-1, contradicting `ψ.FVar?(m-1)`. ⚠️ `Semiformula.quote_inj_iff` needs `(V:=ℕ)(L:=ℒₒᵣ)`
  explicit (ambiguous with `Bootstrapping.Semiformula.quote_inj_iff`); `natCast_nat` normalizes the
  `(k:V)` cast; `rw [← heq] at hfv` rewrites ψ in the INDEX too — use `apply ... ; rw [heq]` instead.

REMAINING (priority order):
1. **mem_iff (⇐)** — `∃ p₀, χ = univCl (succInd p₀)` ⟹ `IsInductionAxiomCode (⌜χ⌝:ℕ)`. Canonical
   witness p=⌜p₀⌝, m=`(succInd p₀).fvSup`, body=⌜fixitr 0 m ▹ succInd p₀⌝, ψ:=succInd p₀. Conjuncts:
   `⌜χ⌝=qqAllItr body m` (`quote_univCl_eq_qqAllItr`); body fv-free m-ary (`quote_isSemiformula` +
   `shift_quote_fixitr`); criticality m=0∨¬(..) — m>0 case is **`not_criticality_aux`** (DONE);
   subst-eq `subst (fvarSeq m) body = succIndCodeRaw ⌜p₀⌝` via `subst_fvarSeq_fixitr` + `succIndCodeRaw_quote`.
2. **mem_iff (⇒)** — `IsInductionAxiomCode (⌜χ⌝:ℕ)` ⟹ `∃ p₀, χ = univCl (succInd p₀)`. Decode p,m,body
   (`IsSemiformula.sound` on p ⟹ p₀; succIndCodeRaw-inversion); from subst-eq + fv-free + criticality
   ⟹ body=⌜fixitr 0 m ▹ succInd p₀⌝, m=fvSup, χ=univCl(succInd p₀). Reuses the same machinery.
3. **`ch : 𝚫₁.Semisentence 1`** + `Defined IsInductionAxiomCode ch` — INDEPENDENT of (1)/(2), pure
   assembly via `HierarchySymbol.Semiformula` combinators (`bexs`/`ball`/`⋏` + `ProperOn.*`/`val_*`)
   over the component graphs (`succIndCodeRawGraph`, `qqAllItrGraph`, `fvarSeqGraph`, `substsGraph`,
   `isSemiformula`). Then `isDelta1 := ProvablyProperOn.ofProperOn`. **Tractable; no deep reflection.**
4. Assemble `inductionSchemeUnivDelta1 := { ch, mem_iff, isDelta1 }`; rewire `Reduction.lean`
   (`peano_not_proves_consistency := @consistent_unprovable 𝗣𝗔 paDelta1 _ _`) ONLY when sorry-free
   (anti-fraud). Headline ALSO needs crux 2 — still DEEP-REFLECTION-blocked.

## ⭐ Lap 80 — `inductionSchemeUnivDelta1`: recognizer is 𝚫₁; mem_iff blocked on bv-reflection

**Build 🟢 green; 6 green commits this lap.** All `PADelta1.lean` lemmas `#print axioms`-clean
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`. Lone sorry still = `inductionSchemeUnivDelta1`.

DONE this lap (all axiom-clean, in `PADelta1.lean`):
- **3a `quote_univCl_eq_qqAllItr`**: `⌜univCl ψ⌝ = qqAllItr ⌜fixitr 0 fvSup ▹ ψ⌝ fvSup`. The forward
  bridge for mem_iff (⇐).
- **`succIndCodeRawGraph`** (`𝚺₁.Semisentence 2`) + `succIndCodeRaw.defined` — concrete model-indep
  graph chaining numeral/substs1/qqBvar/qqAdd/imp/qqAll graphs (needed to reference inside `ch` DSL).
- **`IsInductionAxiomCode`** (the recognizer predicate over V) + `isInductionAxiomCode_definable :
  𝚫₁-Predicate` (via `definability`). ⟹ **the recognizer being Δ₁ is machine-checked** — the math
  heart. `IsFVFree` inlined as `IsSemiformula ∧ shift=self` so definability sees only 𝚫₁ atoms.
- **mem_iff (⇐) conjunct lemmas**: `freeVariables_fixitr_eq_empty`, `shift_quote_fixitr` (fv-free
  body's quote is shift-fixed), `fvar?_fvSup_pred` (fvSup tight: var `fvSup-1` is free when fvSup>0).

REMAINING (the genuine wall — DEEP Foundation-internal reflection):
1. **CRITICALITY (⇐), the crux**: for canonical witness m=`(succInd ψ).fvSup`>0, body=⌜fixitr 0 m ▹
   succInd ψ⌝, must show `¬ IsSemiformula ℒₒᵣ (m-1) body`. Via `IsSemiformula.def`
   (`IsSemiformula L n p ↔ IsUFormula L p ∧ bv L p ≤ n`, `Formula/Basic.lean:1208`) this is
   `m ≤ bv ℒₒᵣ ⌜φ''⌝`. **BLOCKED**: no Foundation lemma computes `bv ℒₒᵣ ⌜φ⌝` from φ's syntactic
   bound-var usage; `fvar?_fvSup_pred` gives the syntactic fact (φ''=fixitr uses `^#(m-1)`) but
   reflecting "`^#(m-1)` occurs ⟹ bv ≥ m" through the quote needs a NEW structural-induction lemma
   `bvQuote : bv ℒₒᵣ ⌜φ⌝ = <syntactic max-bv+1 of φ>` (or a lower-bound version). Aristotle CANNOT
   help (Foundation not in its mathlib-v4.28 env). Attack: induct on φ with `quote_rel/all/...` +
   `bv_all/bv_rel/...` structural lemmas; OR the subst-truncation route (if body were (m-1)-ary,
   `subst (fvarSeq m) body = subst (fvarSeq(m-1)) body` so result lacks free var m-1, contradicting
   `succInd ψ` having free var m-1 — but this ALSO needs a `subst`-ext-on-first-n lemma +
   free-var-occurrence reflection, equally deep).
   **⭐ KEY UNLOCK FOUND (lap 80): `IsSemiformula.sound`** (`Formula/Coding.lean:323`):
   `IsSemiformula L n (φ:ℕ) → ∃ F : SyntacticSemiformula L n, ⌜F⌝ = φ` — internal semiformula codes
   at ℕ ARE quotes. **Criticality route via sound** (avoids building `bvQuote` from scratch):
   work at V=ℕ. Suppose `IsSemiformula ℒₒᵣ (m-1) ⌜φ''⌝` (φ''=fixitr 0 m ▹ succInd ψ, m=fvSup>0).
   `sound` ⟹ ∃ F:(m-1)-ary, `⌜F⌝ = ⌜φ''⌝` (ℕ). Apply internal `subst ℒₒᵣ (fvarSeq m)` to both:
   RHS = `⌜succInd ψ⌝` (subst_fvarSeq_fixitr). LHS: F is (m-1)-ary so the length-m vector's entry m-1
   is unread ⟹ `subst (fvarSeq m) ⌜F⌝ = subst (fvarSeq(m-1)) ⌜F⌝` [**needs subst-congruence lemma**,
   below] `= ⌜F ⇜ (fun i:Fin(m-1)↦&i)⌝` (typed_quote_substs + fvarSeqVec_val). So syntactically
   `succInd ψ = F ⇜ (&·)`; but the opened (m-1)-ary F has free vars ⊆ {0..m-2} ⟹ `(succInd ψ).fvSup
   ≤ m-1 = fvSup-1`, contradicting fvSup>0. The ONE reusable lemma to build:
   **`subst_eq_subst_of` (formula subst congruence)**: `IsSemiformula ℒₒᵣ n p → (∀ i<n, w.[i]=w'.[i])
   → subst ℒₒᵣ w p = subst ℒₒᵣ w' p` — mirror `subst_eq_self` (`Functions.lean:710`,
   `IsSemiformula.pi1_structural_induction`); needs a term-level `termSubst_eq_termSubst_of` too
   (mirror `termSubst_eq_self`, `Term/Functions.lean:145`). Plus `freeVariables (F⇜(&·)) ⊆ {0..m-2}`
   (free vars of an open of an (m-1)-ary formula by &0..&(m-2)) — likely via `Rew`/`freeVariables`
   structural simp on `⇜`.
2. **mem_iff (⇒)**: decode p,m,body; from `subst (fvarSeq m) body = ⌜succInd ψ⌝` + body fv-free m-ary +
   criticality ⟹ body = ⌜fixitr 0 m ▹ succInd ψ⌝ and m=fvSup (fixitr-inversion injectivity). Uses
   `subst_fvarSeq_fixitr` (banked) + `IsSemiformula.sound` (same unlock) + `subst_eq_subst_of`.
3. **`ch : 𝚫₁.Semisentence 1`** + `Defined IsInductionAxiomCode ch`: INDEPENDENT of (1)/(2) — build via
   the `HierarchySymbol.Semiformula` combinators `bexs`/`ball`/`⋏` (have `ProperOn.bexs/.ball/.and` +
   `val_bexs/...` for free ProperOn+eval) over the component graphs (`succIndCodeRawGraph`,
   `qqAllItrGraph`, `fvarSeqGraph`, `substsGraph`, `isSemiformula`, graphDelta of each). Then
   `isDelta1 := ProvablyProperOn.ofProperOn` + `Defined.proper`; `mem_iff` at ℕ via `Defined.iff` +
   the (1)+(2) bridge. **This is the next tractable chunk** (no deep reflection; pure assembly).

## ⭐ Lap 79 — `PA_delta1Definable` front A: brick 2a (`qqAllItr`) DONE; next = free→bound rewrite

Front A (`inductionSchemeUnivDelta1`) decomposes the internal `univCl'` recognizer `closeAll` into
TWO independent pieces. **`closeAll p = qqAllItr (freeToBound m p) m` where `m = fvSup p`**, mirroring
`univCl' φ = ∀⁰* (Rew.fixitr 0 φ.fvSup ▹ φ)` (`Basic/Syntax/Rew.lean:420`).

- ✅ **brick 2a DONE (lap 79, axiom-clean): `qqAllItr p k = ^∀^[k] p`** — PR.Construction, `𝚺₁-Function₂`,
  `qqAllItr_succ'` (front-peel) + `qqAllItr_quote` (`qqAllItr ⌜φ⌝ n = ⌜∀⁰* φ⌝`). `PADelta1.lean §Brick 2a`.
- ✅ **brick 2b DONE (lap 79, axiom-clean): `freeToBound`** (the forward `Rew.fixitr 0 m` analog) —
  term-level `termFreeToBound d t` (`^&x↦^#(x+d)`, `TermRec`) + formula-level `freeToBound d p`
  (`UformulaRec1`, depth-threaded, full rel/nrel/⊤/⊥/∧/∨/∀/∃ simp set), both `𝚺₁-Function₂`.
  **BANKED ASSET — but the recognizer below does NOT use it** (see pivot).
- ⚠️ **PIVOT (lap 79): the recognizer goes BACKWARD via existing `subst`, not forward via `freeToBound`.**
  Matching `freeToBound ⌜φ⌝ = ⌜Rew.fixitr 0 m ▹ φ⌝` hits a dependent-arity wall: `(Rew.fixitr n m).q =
  Rew.fixitr (n+1) m` is ILL-TYPED (codomains `n+m+1` vs `n+1+m`, not defeq) — Foundation omits it on
  purpose. Cleaner recognizer reusing **existing** Foundation lemmas (`subst_comp_fixitr`,
  `typed_quote_substs`):
  `ch(y) := ∃ p ≤ y, IsSemiformula 1 p ∧ ∃ m ≤ y, ∃ body ≤ y, y = qqAllItr body m ∧ L.IsFVFree m body ∧`
  `(m = 0 ∨ ¬ L.IsFVFree (m-1) body) ∧ subst ℒₒᵣ (fvarSeq m) body = succIndCodeRaw p`
  where `fvarSeq m = ⟨^&0,…,^&(m-1)⟩` (internal). KEY BRIDGES (all from existing Foundation):
  · `qqAllItr_quote` (DONE) gives `⌜univCl(succInd ψ)⌝ = qqAllItr ⌜fixitr 0 m ▹ succInd ψ⌝ m`, m = fvSup.
  · `subst (fvarSeq m) ⌜fixitr 0 m ▹ ψ⌝ = ⌜(fixitr 0 m ▹ ψ)⇜(&·)⌝ = ⌜ψ⌝` via `typed_quote_substs` +
    `subst_comp_fixitr` (`Basic/Syntax/Rew.lean:412`, `(fixitr 0 m ▹ φ)⇜(&·) = φ`). Soundness: `body`
    fv-free m-ary ⟹ `subst (fvarSeq·)` is injective (inverse of fixitr), so `body` is pinned.
  · `IsFVFree`-pin replaces the need for an internal `fvSup` function (m forced = fvSup, max bound +1).
  DONE pieces (lap 79, all axiom-clean): (1) ✅ `fvarSeq` (brick 2c) `.[i]=^&i`, `IsSemitermVec`;
  (2) ✅ `subst_fvarSeq_fixitr` (brick 2d) = `subst ℒₒᵣ (fvarSeq m) ⌜fixitr 0 m ▹ φ⌝ = ⌜φ⌝` via
  `fvarSeqVec_val` + `typed_quote_substs` + `subst_comp_fixitr`. **THE crux bridge is banked.**
  REMAINING assembly pieces:
  · (3a) the univCl↔qqAllItr bridge: `(⌜univCl ψ⌝ : V) = qqAllItr ⌜Rew.fixitr 0 ψ.fvSup ▹ ψ⌝ ψ.fvSup`
    — combine `qqAllItr_quote` (`qqAllItr ⌜φ'⌝ n = ⌜∀⁰* φ'⌝`) with `coe_univCl_eq_univCl'`
    (`(univCl ψ : SyntacticFormula) = univCl' ψ = ∀⁰* (fixitr 0 ψ.fvSup ▹ ψ)`) + `Sentence.quote_def`.
  · (3b) build `ch : 𝚫₁.Semisentence 1` as the bounded-∃ recognizer (see ch formula above; uses
    `succIndCodeRaw`, `subst ℒₒᵣ (fvarSeq ·)`, `qqAllItr`, `IsFVFree`/`IsSemiformula`-pin graphs).
  · (4) `mem_iff` at ℕ. (⇐) χ=univCl(succInd ψ): witness p=⌜ψ⌝, m=fvSup, body=⌜fixitr..⌝, close with
    (3a)+(3b)+`succIndCodeRaw_quote`+`subst_fvarSeq_fixitr`. (⇒) decode p=⌜ψ⌝ (IsSemiformula 1), m,body;
    from `subst (fvarSeq m) body = ⌜succInd ψ⌝` + body fv-free m-ary ⟹ body=⌜fixitr 0 m ▹ succInd ψ⌝
    (injectivity / inverse — the one nontrivial sub-argument left), then y=⌜univCl(succInd ψ)⌝∈scheme.
  · (5) `isDelta1` (`ProvablyProperOn.ofProperOn` + properness of the bounded ∃).
  Then rewire `Reduction.lean`: `peano_not_proves_consistency := @consistent_unprovable 𝗣𝗔 paDelta1 _ _`.

generalize `ZDerivation_zsubst` to `aNotEigen d` + `a ∉ FV(conclusion)`") is **insufficient** — proven by
two explicit counterexamples:
- **CE-1**: inner chain conclusion `s'` containing `^&a` ⟹ `aNotEigen`-only does NOT rule out the
  criticality collapse (`^∀(^&a=^&a)` vs `^∀(0=^&a)` both → `^∀(0=0)` under `a↦0`).
- **CE-2**: even with **full Buchholz regularity** (`^&a` only in `F(·)`-occurrences), a substituted
  numeral `i` coinciding with a conclusion term `F(i)` collapses criticality. Rung 2 substitutes the
  whole range `i=0…k-1`, so any inner chain concluding `F(j)`, `j<k`, is hit.

⟹ `ZDerivation_zsubst` cannot be the exact-validity-preserving lemma rung 2 needs. **The chain-rule
criticality design (formula-inequality `tp dᵢ ≠ seqSucc s`, `InternalZ.lean:1204`) is the problem.**
Fork (a DEEP-REFLECTION decision, NOT a grind snap-pick): (1) re-reduction semantics; (2) **structural
criticality** — track the principal premise by index/rank not syntactic inequality (most principled,
matches Buchholz operator-control; largest rewrite); (3) restrict + discharge a side-condition (cheapest,
likely false). **Recommend option 2 when this is next revisited at altitude.**

**This lap pivots to the second front `PA_delta1Definable`** (mandatory for the axiom-free headline; the
operator's literal instruction). Status: `𝗣𝗔 = 𝗣𝗔⁻ + InductionScheme ℒₒᵣ Set.univ`. Foundation has
`Theory.Δ₁` combinators for `∅`/`{φ}`/`T+U`/`insert` (so FINITE theories are reachable) but **NO**
`InductionScheme.Δ₁` (the infinite scheme — the real wall). `𝗣𝗔⁻` is finite (`= 𝗘𝗤 ∪ {17 axioms}`) but
has no `Δ₁` instance yet either. Attack order: (a) `𝗣𝗔⁻.Δ₁` via the finite combinators (tractable brick);
(b) `(InductionScheme ℒₒᵣ Set.univ).Δ₁` = build internal `succInd`/`univCl` recognizer (the multi-lap
arithmetization). `ZDerivation_zsubst` (`d≤a` form) stays banked + axiom-clean.

## ⭐ Lap 76 — rung-1 `ZDerivation_zsubst` 6/7; zK case + a DESIGN OBSTRUCTION (read first)

`ZDerivation_zsubst` (`Zsubst.lean`, end) is proven for atom/zIall/zIneg/zInd/zAxAll/zAxNeg; the **zK
case is a `sorry`** (the lone open hole in the file). Groundwork bricks landed this lap:
- `irk_fvSubst` — `irk (fvSubst a t A) = irk A` (rank invariance; the `isChainInf` rank ingredient). ✅
- `iperm_tp_zsubst` — the **positive** permissibility transfer (Lemma 3.3 conjunct of `zKValid`):
  `iperm (tp d) q → iperm (tp (zsubst d a t)) (fvSubstSeqt a t q)` for `ZDerivation d`. ✅

**⚠ OBSTRUCTION found while proving `iperm_tp_zsubst` (design-level, needs a decision):**
The `zKValid` **criticality** conjunct `¬ iperm (tp di) s` does **NOT** transfer under `fvSubst` the way
the positive `iperm` does. `iperm`'s R-case asks `principalFormula = seqSucc q`; `fvSubst` is *not*
injective on formulas (it collapses `^&a`→`t`), so a chain that was critical (`^∀F(^&a) ≠ seqSucc s`) can
become NON-critical after substitution if `seqSucc s = ^∀F(t)`. I.e. substitution can manufacture a
spurious permissibility match against the conclusion `s`. So the `zK` case of `ZDerivation_zsubst` as
*currently stated* (arbitrary `a`, only `d ≤ a`) is likely **not provable / not true** without an
**eigenvariable-freshness hypothesis** `a ∉ FV(s)` (or `a ∉ FV` of every chain conclusion in `d`).
Three resolutions to weigh next lap (likely needs a fresh-mind judgement, see how-to-get-unblocked):
1. **Add a freshness hypothesis** to `ZDerivation_zsubst` (`a` not occurring free in `d`'s sequents).
   Buchholz's actual reduct substitutes a numeral for the *eigenvariable*, which by the eigenvariable
   side-condition is fresh for all surrounding sequents — so a freshness hypothesis is FAITHFUL, not a
   cheat. Then criticality transfers (no spurious match: `^&a` absent from `s`). The cost: thread
   freshness through the I∀/Ind premises (an inner eigenvariable may equal `a` — but those are
   bound-and-renamed; `zIndWff`/`zIallWff` already pin `e`-freshness). **Recommended — matches the math.**
2. Restrict `ZDerivation_zsubst` to derivations with **no `zK` nodes** (does rung 2's Ind reduct ever
   substitute into a `d1` that contains chains? if chain-free this suffices — CHECK what rung 2 feeds).
3. Define a Δ₁ freshness predicate `aFreshIn d` and carry it; heavier but fully general.

Next lap: pick (1), add `(hfresh : ...)`, redo the zK case using `iperm_tp_zsubst` (positive) + a
`¬iperm` transfer that now goes through because `^&a ∉ s`. The other 6 cases are freshness-agnostic
(already proven) — only the statement gains a hypothesis they ignore.

## Reflection — 2026-06-24 (lap 74, DEEP) — direction KEPT; three sharpenings

Full write-up: `REFLECTION-2026-06-24-lap74.md`. Synthesis for the grind:

**Direction call: KEEP, re-validated from altitude.** crux 2 (internalized finitary-Buchholz-Z
cut-elimination) is the right, *unavoidable* target — PROVED this lap: the banked free-X
`peano_not_proves_TI` is the wrong shape (`γ` can't imply free-`X` TI), the specific-instance route
still needs Gentzen, and the meta-level monument can't be reused internally. No ε₀-strength-free proof
of an ε₀-strength independence result exists. A future lap must NOT re-litigate "resurrect the monument."

**KEEP doing:** the RedSound rung ladder (0.5 ✅ → 1 `zsubst` → 2 Ind reduct → 3 K/cut reduct → 4
dispatch); the reusable `iord`/ω-tower ordinal *assignment* machinery; the lap-71 cascade recipe for
ZPhi side conditions; banking (not deleting, not resurrecting) the Thm-5.6 monument.

**STOP doing:** (1) extending `iR2`/`iCritReduct` infrastructure — lap 70 proved that reduct is NOT
validity-preserving; it is SUPERSEDED by the genuine Option-A reduct. Every new `iR2`-shaped lemma is
on the dead path. The genuine reduct re-fits BOTH validity (RedSound) AND its own descent
`o(R d)≺o(d)`; reuse the C3 templates, not the `iord_iR2_iterate_descends` assembly. (2) treating
`PA_delta1Definable` as an acceptable disclosed residual (operator: axiom-free or abandoned).

**Highest-value next target (re-endorsed):** finish **`ZDerivation_zsubst`** (rung-1 step 2) — see the
lap-73 box below for the resolved plan (freshness via `d ≤ a` code-bound; close the well-formedness gap
by adding `IsSemiformula`/`IsUFormula` to `zIallWff`/`zIndWff`/`zInegWff`, start `zInegWff`). It unblocks
the genuine Ind reduct (rung 2), the more tractable of the two genuine reducts.

**SECOND FRONT (advance when the ladder blocks — design soak / build wait):** `PA_delta1Definable`
(Foundation `Incompleteness/Examples.lean:17`, still an `axiom` upstream + in our pin; arithmetize PA's
induction-scheme Δ₁-definability). Independent of crux 2, mandatory for axiom-free, untouched by any lap
— the biggest non-cut-elimination risk to the endpoint. Bounded (no deep math) but substantial.

**Deferred (after RedSound):** the C0.5 Foundation→Z bridge (`¬Con(PA)` ⟹ a Z ⊥-derivation); blueprint
= Bryce–Goré `Peano.v` 3-layer shape in `archive/findings/ON-LINE-FINDINGS-2026-06-24-bryce-gore-gentzen.md`.

## ⭐⭐⭐ Lap 74 (grind) — WELL-FORMEDNESS GAP (B) CLOSED + Δ₁-motive finding for `ZDerivation_zsubst`

**Landed (green 1323, axiom-clean):** the lap-73 blocker (B) is discharged. Strengthened all three
I-rule `…Wff` predicates with principal-formula formula-hood, via the lap-71 cascade recipe (body +
`…WffDef` σ/π + `_defined` simp; the `isUFormula`/`isSemiformula` splice auto-discharges under
`HierarchySymbol.Semiformula.val_sigma`, no extra `.iff` needed — confirmed by `zKValid` + Foundation's
`IsFormulaSet` precedents):
- `zInegWff p d0` += `IsUFormula ℒₒᵣ p` (σ: `!(isUFormula ℒₒᵣ).sigma p`).
- `zIallWff s a p d0` += `IsSemiformula ℒₒᵣ 1 p` (σ: `!(isSemiformula ℒₒᵣ).sigma 1 p`).
- `zIndWff d` += `IsSemiformula ℒₒᵣ 1 (zIndP d)` (same, on the bound matrix var `p` already in scope).
The strengthened inversions (`zDerivation_zIneg_inv`/`_zIall_inv`/`_zInd_inv`) now surface this for free;
no construction site existed, so zero ZPhi-cascade churn. These feed `fvSubst_inegF` (`IsUFormula`),
`fvSubst_all` (`IsUFormula` via `.isUFormula`), `fvSubst_substs1_fvar` (`IsSemiformula 1`).

**⚠ KEY FINDING for `ZDerivation_zsubst` (the motive must NOT carry unbounded ∀a/∀t).** The naive motive
`P d := ∀ a, d ≤ a → ∀ t, IsSemiterm 0 t → ZDerivation (zsubst d a t)` is **Π₁, not Δ₁** — so it fails
`zDerivation_induction`'s `𝚫₁-Predicate P` requirement. **FIX: fix `a t` OUTSIDE the induction.** State
```
theorem ZDerivation_zsubst {a t : V} (ht : IsSemiterm ℒₒᵣ 0 t) :
    ∀ d, ZDerivation d → d ≤ a → ZDerivation (zsubst d a t)
```
with motive `P d := d ≤ a → ZDerivation (zsubst d a t)` — now Δ₁ (`d ≤ a` Δ₀ + `ZDerivation` Δ₁ ∘ `zsubst`
Σ₁-function, params `a t` fixed). IH threads: child `d0 < d ≤ a ⟹ d0 ≤ a`; eigenvar `e < d ≤ a ⟹ e ≠ a`
(zIall: `a_lt_zIall`; zInd: `e = π₁ at' ≤ at' < zInd` via `pi₁_le_self`+`at_lt_zInd`) discharges
`fvSubst_substs1_fvar`'s `a'≠a`. Build per case via `zDerivation_iff.mpr` 7-tag (mirror
`isNF_iotil_of_ZDerivation`'s rcases at `InternalZ.lean:3792`). Definability of `P`: `ZDerivation`'s
fixpoint-definable instance ∘ `zsubst_definable` + `≤`/`→` combinators (try `definability`).
zK case = the hard one (per-premise IH via `znth_zsubstTable_eq_zsubst` + `zKValid` transfer under subst,
needs `tp`/`iperm` subst-invariance — CHECK). Caveat (lap 73): rung 2's `zsubst d1 at' j` may need a true
`a∉eigenvars(d)` predicate, not just `d ≤ a` — prove the `d ≤ a` version first.

## ⭐⭐⭐ Lap 73 — RUNG 1 STEP 1 DONE + STEP 2 SUBSTRATE COMPLETE (`fstIdx_zsubst`, full subst-commutation)

**Landed (green 1323, all axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`):**
- **Step 1 DONE** (`Zsubst.lean`): `zsubst` table structural correctness (`zsubstTable_seq/_lh`,
  `znth_zsubstTable_eq_zsubst`, `zsubst_eq_zsubstNext`), the 7 per-rule recursion equations
  (`zsubst_zAtom`…`zsubst_zAxNeg`), and **`fstIdx_zsubst : ZDerivation d → fstIdx (zsubst d a t) =
  fvSubstSeqt a t (fstIdx d)`** (7-way `zDerivation_iff` case split).
- **Step 2 SUBSTRATE COMPLETE** (`FvSubst.lean` general-`L`, + 2 lemmas in `Zsubst.lean`):
  `IsUTerm.termFvSubst`/`IsUTermVec.termFvSubst` (UTerm preservation), `IsUFormula.fvSubst`,
  `fvSubst_neg`, `inAnt_fvSubstSeq`, `fvSubst_inegF`, `termBShift_eq_self_of_closed`,
  `termFvSubst_termBShift`, `termFvSubstVec_qVec`, **`termFvSubst_termSubst`** (term subst lemma),
  **`fvSubst_subst`** (formula subst lemma, `pi1_structural_induction`, mirror `substs_substs`), and
  **`fvSubst_substs1_fvar : a'≠a → fvSubst a t (substs1 ^&a' p) = substs1 ^&a' (fvSubst a t p)`**
  (Buchholz regularity; the zIall/zInd succedent transfer). `t` always closed (`IsSemiterm ℒₒᵣ 0 t`).

**NEXT — `ZDerivation_zsubst` assembly (rung-1 step 2 proper). Two findings (design RESOLVED):**

**(A) Freshness = the `d ≤ a` code-bound (no tree predicate needed).** Every internal eigenvariable
`e` of a node `n ≤ d` satisfies `e < n ≤ d` (zIall: `a_lt_zIall : a' < zIall…`; zInd: `e = π₁ at' ≤ at'
< zInd…` via `pi₁_le_self` + `at_lt_zInd`). So state
`ZDerivation_zsubst : ZDerivation d → d ≤ a → IsSemiterm ℒₒᵣ 0 t → ZDerivation (zsubst d a t)`
with motive `P d := ∀ a, d ≤ a → ∀ t, IsSemiterm ℒₒᵣ 0 t → ZDerivation (zsubst d a t)` over
`zDerivation_induction`. Children `< d ≤ a` ⟹ IH applies (`d0 < d ≤ a → d0 ≤ a`); eigenvariables
`e < d ≤ a ⟹ e ≠ a` (`ne_of_lt`), discharging `fvSubst_substs1_fvar`'s `a'≠a`. Build via
`zDerivation_iff.mpr` (one-step) → `ZPhi {ZDerivation} (zsubst d a t)`, 7-tag.
⚠ CAVEAT: rung 2 invokes `zsubst d1 at' j` (eigenvariable `at'`, numeral `j`) — needs `d1 ≤ at'`,
NOT guaranteed by `at' < zInd` alone. So `d ≤ a` may need generalizing to a genuine
"a ∉ eigenvars(d)" tree predicate for the rung-2 USE (a fixpoint/cov predicate). Prove the `d ≤ a`
version first (correct + provable), generalize only if rung 2 forces it.

**(B) WELL-FORMEDNESS GAP — the real blocker.** The commutation lemmas need principal-formula
formula-hood that `ZPhi` does NOT currently carry: `fvSubst_all` needs `IsUFormula p` (zIall/zInd
succedent), `fvSubst_inegF` needs `IsUFormula p` (zIneg), `fvSubst_substs1_fvar` needs
`IsSemiformula ℒₒᵣ 1 p` (zIall/zInd matrix). `zAxAll`/`zAxNeg` disjuncts ALREADY carry `IsUFormula p`;
I∀/I¬/Ind do NOT. **Fix = lap-71 cascade**: add `IsSemiformula ℒₒᵣ 1 p` to `zIallWff`/`zIndWff` and
`IsUFormula ℒₒᵣ p` to `zInegWff` (both `𝚫₁`: `isSemiformula L`/`isUFormula L` Defs exist). Blast radius
is SMALL — the `ZPhi` plumbing (`zphi_monotone`/`_strong_finite`/`zphi_iff`/blueprint σ-π/`zPhi_definable`)
threads `…Wff` OPAQUELY; only the `…WffDef` + `_defined` proof change, and the `_inv` lemmas return more
(callers unaffected). Risk: the `_defined` 𝚫₁ proof (mirror how `zKValidDef` embeds `(isUFormula ℒₒᵣ).sigma/.pi`
under `val_sigma`). Start with `zInegWff` (binary, fewest sites: def 1264, Def 1269, _defined 1279, σ-core
3709, π-core 3727, definable 3747, inv 4853), validate the recipe, then zIall/zInd.

**Assembly per-case sketch (after B):** atom→`inAnt_fvSubstSeq` (no fresh/IH); zIall→IH(d0)+`fvSubst_all`+
`fvSubst_substs1_fvar`(a'≠a)+`seqAnt` via `fvSubstSeq`; zIneg→IH+`fvSubst_inegF`; zInd→2×IH+numeral/qqAdd
commutation (`termFvSubst` of `numeral 0`/`qqAdd (^&a) (numeral 1)` — numerals closed so fixed; need
`termFvSubst_numeral`/`_qqAdd` helpers); zK→per-premise IH via `znth_zsubstTable_eq_zsubst`+`zKValid`
transfer (iperm/tp invariance under subst — likely needs `tp_fvSubst`/`iperm` subst-invariance, CHECK);
zAxAll/zAxNeg→`IsUFormula.fvSubst`+`inAnt_fvSubstSeq`. Then step 3 `iotil_zsubst = iotil` (õ subst-inv).

## ⭐⭐⭐ Lap 72 — RUNG 1 `zsubst` DEFINED (eigenvariable substitution on Z-derivations)

**Landed (green 1323, axiom-clean), see `HANDOFF-2026-06-24-lap72.md` for the full ledger:**
- `src/GoodsteinPA/FvSubst.lean` (new `module`): `termFvSubst a t u` (term-level free-var subst
  `^&a↦t`, `Language.TermRec`) + `fvSubst a t p` (formula-level, `UformulaRec1`, param `⟪a,t⟫`,
  identity `allChanges` since `t` closed) + definability + `fvSubst_isSemiformula` (preservation,
  closed `t`). Resolves PENDING's open "free-var subst is not `substs1`" design question.
- `src/GoodsteinPA/Zsubst.lean` (new): `fvSubstSeq`/`fvSubstSeqt` (seq/sequent subst), `tblMapSeq`
  (zK premise table-map), `zsubstNext` (7-tag table step), `zsubst d a t` (course-of-values
  `<`-recursion, mirror `iRTable`/`iR2`), all `𝚺₁`-definable. Added `zIallEig`/`zAxAllK` accessors.

**NEXT — rung 1 CORRECTNESS (the def is in place; prove it does the right thing):**
1. `fstIdx_zsubst : fstIdx (zsubst d a t) = fvSubstSeqt a t (fstIdx d)` (diagonal table read-out, mirror
   `iR2`'s `znth_iRTable` lemmas in `InternalZ.lean` ~4380+, then 7-tag `fstIdx (z* s' …) = s'`). EASIEST.
2. `ZDerivation_zsubst` (rung-1 correctness): child `<` bounds + per-rule subst-commutation + likely an
   eigenvariable-freshness hyp; drive by `ZDerivation`-induction + lap-70 `zDerivation_z*_inv`.
3. `iotil_zsubst = iotil` (õ subst-invariance; shape+rank based, `irk` subst-invariant — prove
   `irk_fvSubst` analog of `irk_substs1`). Likely EASIEST after (1).
Then **rung 2** (genuine Ind reduct) reachable. Cut-elim shape blueprint: `~/src/Gentzen/.../cut_elim.v`.

## ⭐⭐⭐ Lap 71 — FRESH-MIND REVIEW + rung-0.5 I¬ wired (cascade de-risked)

**Review:** direction KEPT (Option A forced lap 70, kernel re-verified: headline 0 math axioms; lap-70
landmarks clean; build green 1321). STATUS refreshed off stale lap-59/62 framing.

**Landed (green 1321, axiom-clean):** the rung-0.5 cascade is now PROVEN OUT on the simplest disjunct.
Moved `zInegWff` up before `ZPhi`, gave it `zInegWffDef : 𝚫₁.Semisentence 2` + `zInegWff_defined`
(`𝚫₁-Relation`, mirrors `zKValidDef` — all 𝚺₀ pieces: `fstIdx`/`seqSucc`/`seqAnt`/`^⊥`/`inAnt`), and wired
`∧ zInegWff p d0` into the I¬ disjunct across the WHOLE cascade: `ZPhi` def, `zphi_monotone`,
`zphi_strong_finite`, `zphi_iff` (both directions), `zblueprint` σ-core (`!(zInegWffDef.sigma) p d0`) +
π-core (`!(zInegWffDef.pi) p d0`), `zPhi_definable` simp (`+zInegWff_defined.iff`). **Only 2 inversion
sites broke** (the rest use `_` tails) — fixed `zTag_Ind_or_K_of_ZDerivesEmpty` (`hsc → hsc,_`) and
**STRENGTHENED `zDerivation_zIneg_inv`** to return `ZDerivation d0 ∧ seqSucc s = inegF p ∧ zInegWff p d0`
(the payoff: I¬ inversion now hands the premise-sequent data the genuine reduct reads).

**Cascade recipe (now battle-tested for I∀/Ind next):** (1) def the `…Wff` + `…WffDef : 𝚫₁.Semisentence n`
+ `_defined` instance ABOVE `ZPhi` (placed after `zKValid_definable`, ~line 1252); (2) add `∧ …Wff …` to
the `ZPhi` disjunct; (3) propagate the binder through `zphi_monotone`/`_strong_finite`/`zphi_iff` (×4
patterns); (4) `∧ !(…WffDef.sigma) …` into zblueprint σ-core, `∧ !(…WffDef.pi) …` into π-core; (5)
`+…Wff_defined.iff` to `zPhi_definable`'s second simp; (6) `lake build`, fix the ≤2 inversion sites that
name the disjunct's last conjunct — strengthen the corresponding `_inv` lemma to surface the `…Wff`.

**I∀ DONE (this lap too, green 1321, axiom-clean):** wired `zIallWff s a p d0` identically — moved up,
`zIallWffDef : 𝚫₁.Semisentence 4` (`substs1Graph ℒₒᵣ` for `seqSucc(fstIdx d0)=substs1 (^&a) p`, `qqFvarDef`
for `^&a`), `zIallWff_defined : 𝚫₁-Relation₄` (the σ/π simp needs `(substs1.defined (L := ℒₒᵣ)).iff` — `L`
must be pinned or instance synth fails), wired through the full cascade, and **STRENGTHENED
`zDerivation_zIall_inv`** to return `… ∧ zIallWff s a p d0` (recover the eigenvariable `a` via
`congrArg (fun d => π₁ (zRest d)) h` — there is no `zIallEig` accessor; `zRest (zIall s a p d0)=⟪a,p,d0⟫`).

**Ind DONE (this lap too — RUNG 0.5 COMPLETE, green 1321, axiom-clean):** `zIndWff` built as a UNARY
predicate on the whole node `d` (sidesteps the missing `𝚫₁-Relation₅` notation AND lets its body be
strengthened later WITHOUT re-running the cascade). Added accessors `zIndEig`/`zIndTerm` (`= π₁/π₂ (π₁
(zRest d))`, the `at'=⟪a,t⟫` decode) + their `𝚺₀` Defs; `zIndWffDef : 𝚫₁.Semisentence 1` +
`zIndWff_defined : 𝚫₁-Predicate`. Term-codes from Foundation `Bootstrapping.Arithmetic`: `numeral`
(`numeralGraph`; `numeral 0 = 𝟎`), `qqAdd` (`qqAddGraph`; `Sa = qqAdd (^&a) (numeral 1)`). Conditions:
`d0 ⊢ Γ→F(0)` (`seqAnt(fstIdx d0)=seqAnt s`, `seqSucc(fstIdx d0)=substs1 (numeral 0) p`), `d1 ⊢
F(a),Γ→F(Sa)` (`inAnt (substs1 (^&a) p) (seqAnt(fstIdx d1))`, `seqSucc(fstIdx d1)=substs1 (Sa) p`),
conclusion `seqSucc s = substs1 t p`. Wired `∧ zIndWff d` into the Ind disjunct across the cascade;
strengthened `zDerivation_zInd_inv` to return `… ∧ zIndWff (zInd s at' p d0 d1)` (recovering all 5
components from `h`). Gotchas: `numeral`/`qqAdd`/`numeralGraph`/`qqAddGraph` live in
`LO.FirstOrder.Arithmetic.Bootstrapping.Arithmetic` (not the bare `…Arithmetic`); the `𝚫₁-Predicate`
instance simp needs `and_assoc` to reconcile the right-nested core with `zIndWff`'s grouping.

⚠️ **`zIndWff` deliberately OMITS the `Γ ⊆ ant(d1)` threading** (the bounded-∀ `∀ i < lh(seqAnt s),
inAnt (znth (seqAnt s) i) (seqAnt(fstIdx d1))`) the genuine Ind reduct's `isChainInf` will need. Because
`zIndWff` is unary, ADDING that conjunct later only re-proves `zIndWffDef`/`zIndWff_defined` — it does NOT
touch the ZPhi cascade. Add it when building rung 2.

**NEXT — rung 1+ (the genuine reduct, the deep crux-2 core):**
- **rung 1 `zsubst d a n`** — Σ₁ eigenvariable substitution on Z-derivations (numeral `n` for free var `a`),
  `ZDerivation`-preserving + `iotil`-invariant + `fstIdx`-computing. Σ₁ recursion over the tree applying
  `substs1`/`Rew` per node. Multi-lap brick. (See lap-70 LADDER below for the full plan + sub-bricks.)
- **rung 2** genuine Ind reduct (most tractable — premises genuine, not `Rep`); **rung 3** genuine K/cut
  reduct; **rung 4** `RedSound` tag-dispatch → closes the descent → `Reduction.lean:68`.

## ⭐⭐⭐ Lap 70 — Option B REFUTED in-kernel; Option A (genuine reduct) ladder

**Finding (kernel-checked, `not_zKValid_iCritReduct`):** the ordinal-faithful `iR2` can NEVER preserve
`zKValid` — `iCritReduct`'s premises are chains (`iCritAux = zK …`, `tp = isymRep`, permissible
everywhere), breaking `zKValid`'s criticality conjunct, which the L3.1 redex finder requires. So lap-69's
**Option B is dead**; **`RedSound` is false for the current `iR2`**. (Cross-checked vs Bryce–Goré: their
`cut_elimination` is genuinely validity-preserving + shape-dispatched — `~/src/Gentzen/.../cut_elim.v`.)

**Buchholz genuine reductions (Def 3.2 / 14.23–14.25, `scratchpad/buchholz-gentzen.txt:184-265`):**
- **I¬ (14.23):** `d[0] := d0`. No substitution. ✅ `ZDerivation_iR2_zIneg` (lap 70, clean).
- **I∀ (14.23):** `d[n] := d0(a/n)` — eigenvariable `a` replaced by numeral `n` throughout `d0`.
- **Ind (14.24):** `d[0] := K^r⟨d0, d1(0), d1(1), …, d1(k−1)⟩`, `k = ⟦induction term⟧` (a numeral since
  `d` closed). Premises: `d0 : Γ→F(0)`, `d1(i) : F(i),Γ→F(i+1)`. **Valid chain** because each premise
  `d1(i)`'s antecedent formula `F(i)` is the PRIOR premise's succedent (threading ✓). Needs the
  substituted copies `d1(a/i)` + count `k`.
- **Chain/K (14.25):** the cut-elimination proper — shape-dispatched on the cut formula (atom/neg/∀).

**THE foundational brick = eigenvariable substitution on Z-derivations `zsubst : V→V→V→V`** (substitute
numeral `n` for free variable `a` throughout derivation `d`), Σ₁-definable + `ZDerivation`-preserving.
Building blocks in hand: Foundation's coded-formula substitution `substs1 ℒₒᵣ t p` (used already in
`irk_substs1`), rank-substitution-invariance `irk_substs1`, the peeling inversions
`zDerivation_zIall_inv`/`_zIneg_inv`/`_zAxAll_inv`/`_zAxNeg_inv` (lap 70). `zsubst` is a Σ₁ recursion over
the derivation tree applying `substs1` at each sequent — mirror the `iRTable`/`iCritReduct` blueprint
recursions. Multi-lap; build incrementally.

**LADDER (hardest-first within Option A; the Ind case is the more tractable wall — its reduct premises are
genuine sub-derivations, NOT `Rep`, so not definitionally blocked like the K-case):**
0.5. **PREREQUISITE — strengthen `ZPhi`'s I∀/Ind disjuncts with the premise-sequent + eigenvariable side
   conditions** (a Σ₁/Δ₁ Fixpoint cascade, exactly like laps 66/69's leaf + K cascades). The CURRENT
   `ZPhi` zIall disjunct is `d = zIall s a p d0 ∧ d0 ∈ C ∧ seqSucc s = ^∀ p` — it does NOT say `d0` derives
   `Γ→F(a)` (Buchholz I∀ requires `fstIdx d0 = mkSeqt (seqAnt s) (substs1 (^&a) p)` + `a ∉ conclusion`).
   Likewise the Ind disjunct omits `fstIdx d0 = Γ→F(0)` / `fstIdx d1 = F(a),Γ→F(Sa)`. **Without these the
   genuine reduct's THREADING (isChainInf) is unprovable** — after substitution `σi = zsubst d1 a i` you
   can't compute its sequent `F(i),Γ→F(i+1)`. (This under-constraining does NOT break the descent
   direction — the C0.5 bridge produces a genuine derivation that still satisfies the weaker `ZPhi`, and
   the ordinal descent uses only NF facts — but it DOES block `RedSound`.) Building block landed lap 70:
   `isChainInf_of_last` (reduces chain-validity to premise-local threading).
   ⚠️ **DESIGN DECISION needed first (lap-70 finding):** `at'` in `zInd s at' p d0 d1` is currently
   **opaque/unused** (never decoded; the Ind semantics F(0)/F(Sa)/F(t)/eigenvar/term are entirely
   unencoded). The cascade must DECODE it — recommend `at' = ⟪a, t⟫` (eigenvariable `a`, induction term
   `t`), accessors `zIndEig := π₁ at'` / `zIndTerm := π₂ at'`. Exact Buchholz Ind conditions (rules read
   lap 70, `scratchpad/buchholz-gentzen.txt:140-152`):
   - `seqAnt (fstIdx d0) = seqAnt s ∧ seqSucc (fstIdx d0) = substs1 ℒₒᵣ ‘0’ p`  (d0 ⊢ Γ→F(0))
   - `seqSucc (fstIdx d1) = substs1 ℒₒᵣ (S(^&a)) p ∧ inAnt (substs1 ℒₒᵣ (^&a) p) (seqAnt (fstIdx d1))`
     ∧ Γ-threading of `seqAnt (fstIdx d1)`  (d1 ⊢ F(a),Γ→F(Sa))
   - `seqSucc s = substs1 ℒₒᵣ t p`  (conclusion ⊢ Γ→F(t))
   Verify the term constructors first: `^&a` = `qqFvar a`; the successor term `S(^&a)`; `‘0’` numeral
   (used in `IRk.blueprint:312`). `substs1`/`inAnt` already Δ₁ — so the cascade is mechanical once the
   conditions + at'-decode are pinned. I∀ analog: `seqSucc (fstIdx d0) = substs1 ℒₒᵣ (^&a) p` with
   `at' → a` the eigenvariable (zIall already has the `a` slot).
1. **`zsubst d a n`** — Σ₁ derivation substitution. Sub-bricks: per-node sequent substitution (apply
   `substs1`/`Rew` to `fstIdx`), recurse on `zIallPrem`/`zInegPrem`/`zIndPrem0/1`/`zKseq`. Prove
   `ZDerivation_zsubst` (preserves validity) + `iotil_zsubst = iotil` (õ substitution-invariance — the
   ordinal side already assumes this; make it a theorem) + `fstIdx_zsubst` (the reduced end-sequent).
2. **Genuine Ind reduct `iRInd'`** = `zK s (irk p) ⟨d0, zsubst d1 at' 0, …, zsubst d1 at' (k−1)⟩` with
   `k = ⟦induction-term-of d⟧`. Build the substituted-block sequence (Σ₁ recursion reading `zsubst d1 at' i`
   at index `i`; mirror `iRepeatSeq`). Prove `zKValid` of it — the **threading** is the genuine content
   (premise `i+1`'s antecedent `F(i)` = premise `i`'s succedent; rank `irk(F(i)) ≤ r` via `irk_substs1`).
3. **`RedSound` for tag 3 (Ind)** falls out: `ZDerivation (iRInd' …)` from step 2's `zKValid` +
   `znth_…_ZDerivation`. Re-fit `iord_descent` to `iRInd'` (õ-side survives via `iotil_zsubst`).
4. **Genuine critical reduct (K-case, tag 4)** = the cut-elimination, shape-dispatched (Bryce–Goré
   `cut_elimination_atom`/`_neg`/`_lor`). Hardest. Peel R-redex (`zDerivation_zIall_inv` → `d0`, then
   `zsubst` for I∀) + L-redex (`zDerivation_zAxAll_inv`/`_zAxNeg_inv`) and splice into a chain whose
   premises are genuine (non-`Rep`) sub-derivations. Prove `zKValid` + re-fit `iord` descent.
5. **`RedSound`** (`∀ d, ZDerivesEmpty d → ZDerivation (iR2 d)`) = tag-dispatch on 3 (Ind) + 4 (K).
   Then `iord_iR2_iterate_descends` (already assembled) closes the descent → C0.5 bridge → `Reduction:68`.

**Banked lap 70 (all axiom-clean, green 1321):** `zDerivation_zIall_inv`/`_zIneg_inv`/`_zAxAll_inv`/
`_zAxNeg_inv`/`_zAtom_inv` (peeling), `not_zKValid_of_zK_premise`/`not_zKValid_iCritReduct` (obstruction),
`ZDerivation_iR2_zIall`/`_zIneg` (clean I-rule `RedSound` fragment), `isChainInf_of_last` (chain-validity
from premise-local threading), `iCritReductSeq_lh`/`znth_iCritReductSeq_zero`.

**Foundation substitution API (for `zsubst`):** `subst L w p` (vector subst, `Functions.lean:429`),
`substs1 L t p := subst L ?[t] p` (`:759`), `shift L p` (`:276`), `free p := substs1 L ^&0 (shift L p)`
(`:784`); free vars are `^&i` (`qqFvar`). Eigenvariable subst (free var `a` → numeral) is NOT `substs1`
(that's for bound var 0); needs a free-var replacement built from `subst`/`shift` — investigate next.

## ⭐⭐ Lap 67 — THE tag-4 K-case descent ASSEMBLED (`iord_descent_iR2_zK_of_valid`, axiom-clean)

The crux-2 ordinal nut for the chain/cut rule is machine-checked. `iord_descent_iR2_zK_of_valid`
(end of `src/GoodsteinPA/InternalZ.lean`) proves `o(iR2 (zK s r ds)) ≺ o(zK s r ds)` for a valid
`K^r` chain whose premises are `ZDerivation`s, **conditional on `zKValid s r ds`** (the Buchholz K^r
side conditions). Axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, green 1321 jobs.

Banked substrate this lap (all axiom-clean, all in `src/`):
- `tp_cases` (tp-trichotomy) + `tp_eq_isymR_of_pi₁_zero`/`tp_eq_isymLk_of_pi₁_one` + `isymIsR`/
  `pi₁_isym*` (π₁-discriminant 0/1/2) ⟹ `redexPair_tp`: read `tp(redexI)=R_A` ∧ `tp(redexJ)=L^k_A`
  (shared cut) off the bare `isRedexPair` finder least-pair.
- `iRedDescent_zAxReduct_of_iRedDescent` (wrap collapse via `icmp_trans`, handles the I-rule
  sub-derivation being an axiom leaf) + `iRedDescent_zAxReduct_iR2_of_tp_isymR` (i-side) /
  `_isymLk` (j-side) ⟹ the six ρ-facts of `iord_descent_iRcrit_of_chain'` at `ρ = zAxReduct∘iR2`.
- `zKValid s r ds` Prop bundle = `isChainInf` ∧ per-premise `iperm`(perm) ∧ `¬iperm`(crit) ∧ per-tag
  principal-formula `IsUFormula` (tags 1,2,5,6).

### ▶ NEXT PHASE (the one remaining structural gap): wire `zKValid` into the `ZPhi` `zK` disjunct
The bare `zK` disjunct is `Seq ds ∧ ∀ i<lh ds, premise ∈ C` — it does NOT carry `zKValid`, so a
genuine `ZDerivation`'s K-node doesn't yet hand you validity. Strengthen the `zK` disjunct to
`… ∧ zKValid s r ds` (faithful: an unconstrained premise sequence is NOT a valid system-Z `K^r`
inference). This is a Σ₁/Δ₁ **Fixpoint cascade** (one focused atomic pass, build only at the end):
1. **Definability of `zKValid` ingredients** (currently MISSING, all bounded/Δ₁ — build as blueprint
   `Def`s or inline): `seqAnt`/`seqSucc` (=π₁/π₂, trivial), `inAnt` (bounded ∃), `iperm` (Or of
   isym-equalities + `inAnt`), `chainAsucc`/`chainAnt` (=seqSucc/seqAnt∘fstIdx), `isChainInf`
   (bounded ∃ j0 + bounded ∀'s over `irk`/`inAnt`), `zAxAllF`/`zAxNegF` (=π₁∘zRest / zRest).
   `irk` is Σ₁ (`irkDef`), `IsUFormula` is Δ₁ (`(isUFormula ℒₒᵣ).sigma/.pi`).
2. Add `zKValid` (as Δ₁) to BOTH zblueprint Σ and Π cores (mirror how `IsUFormula` embeds
   `.sigma`/`.pi`), update `ZPhi` def + `zphi_monotone`/`zphi_strong_finite`/`zphi_iff`/`zPhi_definable`
   (the zK disjunct gets the extra conjunct; `zKValid` has no `C`-dependence so monotone/strong_finite
   are trivial on it), and the ~6 `rcases zDerivation_iff.mp` sites (zK pattern gains `hvalid`).
3. Then `zDerivation_zK_inv` yields `zKValid`; **extend `iord_descent_iR2_struct` tag-4 case** to
   `exact iord_descent_iR2_zK_of_valid hds hmem hvalid` (replacing the current `simp [zTag_zK] at htag`),
   dropping the `htag` restriction ⟹ the UNCONDITIONAL `ZDerivation d → icmp (iord (iR2 d)) (iord d)=0`.
NB: this cascade is sizeable but the pattern is known (lap-66 did the §5-leaf cascade). The descent
MATH is now entirely banked — only this faithfulness/definability wiring remains before the
no-infinite-descent → `ZDerivesEmpty d → False` → C0.5 bridge → `Reduction.lean:68`.

## ⭐ Lap 66 — crux-2 island promoted to src/ + green-gated; K-case j-side architecture pinned

**Done this lap:** (P0+P1a) Farmed goodstein-ab-xhigh's recursive-iR2 spine (3937 lines, the
architectural keystone) and PROMOTED it out of the un-built `wip/` island into
`src/GoodsteinPA/InternalZ.lean`, imported by the aggregator. `lake build GoodsteinPA` (1321 jobs)
now type-checks it every lap AND the sorry-gate scans it (it is sorry-free). Capstones verified
axiom-clean. Then banked the j-side §5 atomic-reduct bundle `iRedDescent_zAx1_zAxAll/_zAxNeg`.

**P1b (med graft) — NOT mergeable as-is.** goodstein-ab-med used an INCOMPATIBLE symbol encoding
(`iRsym C = ⟪0,C,0⟫+1`, `iLsym A k = ⟪1,A,k⟫+1`, `isymKind/isymFml` via `π₁(I-1)`) vs xhigh's
(`isymR A = ⟪0,A⟫`, `isymLk k A = ⟪1,k,A⟫`). med's atomic chain (`ZDerivesEmpty_descends_critical_atomic`,
60-decl closure) bottoms out on med's `tp`/`ZPhi`/`ZDerivation` over that encoding, so it does not
compile against the xhigh spine — grafting it = re-deriving against xhigh's layer, i.e. NEW work, not
a merge. xhigh ALREADY has the §5 atomic layer (`zAxAll`/`zAxNeg`/`zAx1`/`oAtom1`/`icmp_oAtom1_oAtomLk`),
so med's value is largely duplicated; do NOT spend laps porting med's encoding.

**THE pinned crux-2 frontier (the genuine remaining math, K-case = tag 4):**
`iord_descent_iR2_struct` proves the descent `o(iR2 d) ≺ o(d)` UNCONDITIONALLY for I-rules (tags 1,2)
and Ind (tag 3). The K-rule (tag 4) reduces — via `iord_descent_iRcrit_of_chain'` — to six `ρ`-facts
about the two redex premises (`ρ = iR2(znth ds ·)`):
  - **i-side (R-redex, an I-rule): DONE** concretely (`iRedDescent_iR2_of_tp_isymR`).
  - **j-side (L-axiom redex, tags 5/6): the BLOCKER.** `iR2` is the IDENTITY on atomic axioms
    (`iR2_zAxAll`/`iR2_zAxNeg` proven), so `ρ(redexJ)=znth ds j` and the required strict drop
    `icmp (iotil (ρ j)) (iotil (znth ds j)) = 0` is FALSE (irreflexive). The §5 reduct `zAx1`
    (strict drop, banked as `iRedDescent_zAx1_z*` this lap) cannot enter through the `iR2` table.
**Path 2 (weaken j-side to `≤`) RULED OUT** (lap 66, verified): the K-case descent
`iord_descent_iCritReduct` proves `o(d[0]) ≺ o(d)` via `iord_descent_cut` = (degree drop N3a) ∧
(õ-side N3b). N3b is `icmp_omega_pow_nadd_lt h0o h1o` = `ω^{õd{0}} # ω^{õd{1}} ≺ ω^{õ(d)}`, which
genuinely needs BOTH `õ(d{ν}) ≺ õ(d)` STRICT (a `#` of two ω-powers is `≺ ω^c` only if both exponents
`< c`). And `õ(d{1}) ≺ õ(d)` traces back (via `iotil_iCritAux_lt`) to strict drop on the replaced
j-premise. With `vj = iR2(atom) = atom`, `õ(d{1}) = õ(d)` — descent FAILS. **So the current `iR2` does
NOT achieve descent on tag-4; the §5 j-reduct is genuinely required, not optional.**

**Done lap 66:** defined the §5 reduct FUNCTION `zAxReduct : V → V` (`zAxAll s p k ↦ zAx1 s p`,
`zAxNeg s p ↦ zAx1 s p`, identity off tags 5/6) + rewrite lemmas `zAxReduct_zAxAll/_zAxNeg` + the
j-side bundles `iRedDescent_zAxReduct_zAxAll/_zAxNeg` (axiom-clean). This is the function the critical
reduct must install on the j-side.

**DONE path-1 steps 1+2 (lap 66):**
  1. ✅ `zAxReductDef` (Σ₁-definability of `zAxReduct`) — axiom-clean.
  2. ✅ **Rewired `iRNext` tag-4** (the `iR2` table step) so BOTH premise reducts are wrapped in
     `zAxReduct`: `iCritReduct d i j (zAxReduct (iR2 premᵢ)) (zAxReduct (iR2 premⱼ))`. `zAxReduct` is the
     identity off atomic-axiom tags (so harmless on the i-side I-rule sub-derivation, which is a
     `ZDerivation` ⟹ tag ∈ {0..4} ⟹ never 5/6) and is the §5 `Ax^1` reduct on the j-side L-axiom redex.
     `iRNextDef` re-proven; `iR2_zK` + `iR2_zK_eq_iRcrit` updated to `ρ = fun n ↦ zAxReduct (iR2 (znth ds n))`.
     All axiom-clean, green (1321 jobs). **The reduction `iR2` now genuinely descends on tag-4 in
     principle** — the j-premise õ strictly drops.

**NEXT-LAP ATTACK (assemble the unconditional K-case, then the whole induction):**
  3. **`zAxReduct_of_ZDerivation`** (`ZDerivation d → zAxReduct d = d`): from `zDerivation_iff`, a
     ZDerivation's tag ∈ {0,1,2,3,4} (zAtom/zIall/zIneg/zInd/zK), never 5/6, so `zAxReduct` is the
     identity. Needed to collapse the i-side wrap `zAxReduct (iR2 premᵢ) = iR2 premᵢ` in the descent.
  4. **Tag-5/6 inversion + UFormula** (`zTag d = 5 → ∃ s p k, d = zAxAll s p k`, similarly tag 6): to
     apply `iRedDescent_zAxReduct_zAxAll/_zAxNeg` to a redexJ premise known by `tp = isymLk k A`. The
     `IsUFormula p` side comes from the chain's `hwfL`/`zKWff` well-formedness data — locate it.
  5. **Assemble `iord_descent_iR2_struct` for tag 4**: feed `iord_descent_iCritReduct_object` with
     `v = zAxReduct (iR2 premᵢ)` (= `iR2 premᵢ` via step 3, descent from `iRedDescent_iR2_of_tp_isymR`)
     and `w = zAxReduct (iR2 premⱼ)` (= `zAx1` via `iR2_zAxAll`+`zAxReduct_zAxAll`, descent from
     `iRedDescent_zAxReduct_zAxAll`). The redex `(i,j)` + `tp` facts come from
     `inference_critical_pair_of_chain` (already used inside `iord_descent_iRcrit_of_chain'`). Likely
     route: discharge the six `ρ`-facts of `iord_descent_iRcrit_of_chain'` at `ρ = zAxReduct ∘ iR2`,
     then `rw [← iR2_zK_eq_iRcrit]`.
  NOTE: atomic axioms (tags 5/6) are NOT standalone `ZDerivation` constructors — they appear only as
  chain premises, so the j-side lemma keys off the premise CODE being `zAxAll`/`zAxNeg`.
Then the UNCONDITIONAL `ZDerivation d → icmp (iord (iR2 d)) (iord d) = 0` (all tags), the
no-infinite-descent → `ZDerivesEmpty d → False`, C0.5 bridge, wire `Reduction.lean:68`.

## ✅ RESOLVED lap 66: ZPhi extended with the §5 axiom base cases (the structural gap is closed)

`ZPhi`/`ZDerivation` now has 7 disjuncts: zAtom/zIall/zIneg/zInd/zK **+ zAxAll (tag 5) + zAxNeg
(tag 6)**, each carrying `IsUFormula ℒₒᵣ p`. Full cascade fixed & axiom-clean, green (1321 jobs):
ZPhi def, zphi_monotone, zphi_strong_finite, zphi_iff, zblueprint (Σ/Π cores embed
`(isUFormula ℒₒᵣ).sigma`/`.pi`), zPhi_definable, isNF_iotil_of_ZDerivation (new leaves via
`isNF_iotil_zAxAll/_zAxNeg`), and all 6 `rcases zDerivation_iff.mp` sites (+2 patterns each).
`zAxReduct_of_ZDerivation` → `zAxReduct_of_tp_isymR` (the ZDerivation form is now false since axioms
are leaves; the i-side redex premise has `tp = isymR` ⟹ tag 1/2, so `zAxReduct = id`). Added
`k_lt_zAxAll`. **The redex finder can now fire on a genuine `ZDerivation` — the K-case is reachable.**

**NEXT: assemble `iord_descent_iR2_struct` for tag 4 (the K-case), then the full induction.**
The pieces are all banked & axiom-clean:
  - chain inversion `zDerivation_zK_inv` (premises are ZDerivations OR §5 axioms now),
  - `iR2_zK_eq_iRcrit` (ρ = zAxReduct ∘ iR2), the nut `iord_descent_iRcrit_of_chain'`,
  - i-side: `iRedDescent_iR2_of_tp_isymR` + `zAxReduct_of_tp_isymR` (collapse the wrap),
  - j-side: `iRedDescent_zAxReduct_zAxAll/_zAxNeg` (needs `IsUFormula p`, now carried by the leaf).
  Route: from `ZDerivation (zK s r ds)` derive the chain hyps (hchain/hrank/hwfR/hwfL/hperm/hnperm
  from the chain validity — CHECK what `zDerivation_zK_inv` + the zK ZPhi disjunct give vs what the
  nut needs; the chain-validity predicates `chainAsucc`/`chainAnt`/`isChainInf` may need a bridge from
  the bare `∀ i < lh ds, znth ds i ∈ ZDerivation`), then discharge the six ρ-facts at redexI/redexJ.
  ⚠️ GAP TO CHECK: the nut needs `hchain`/`hAj0`/`hrank` (chain-structure predicates). The ZPhi zK
  disjunct only gives `Seq ds ∧ ∀ i<lh ds, premise ∈ ZDerivation` — NOT the chain antecedent-threading
  (`chainAnt`/`chainAsucc`) the redex finder consumes. Either (a) the zK ZPhi disjunct must be
  strengthened to a genuine `isChainInf`-style condition, or (b) those predicates are derivable from
  the premise sequents. Resolve this before the final assembly.

## (historical) THE blocking structural gap (lap 66): ZPhi lacks the §5 axiom base cases — RESOLVED above

`ZPhi` (line ~3165) — the `ZDerivation` fixpoint — has exactly 5 disjuncts: zAtom / zIall / zIneg /
zInd / zK. **No tag-5/6 disjunct.** So every chain premise (`znth ds i ∈ C` = a `ZDerivation`) has tag
∈ {0..4}, NEVER 5/6. But `tp` assigns the L-symbol `isymLk` ONLY to tags 5/6 (`zAxAll`/`zAxNeg`), and
the redex finder (`inference_critical_pair_of_chain`) needs a premise with `tp = isymLk` at the j-end.
⟹ **on a genuine `ZDerivation`, the redex finder never fires** — the K-case is unreachable, not just
unproven. The §5 L-axioms are Buchholz logical-axiom LEAVES (the only source of left symbols, tp
comment p.12) and MUST be `ZPhi` base cases. (med's arm added them via `ZDerivation_zAxInst/_zAx1`.)

**EXTENSION PLAN (atomic change — nothing compiles until the whole cascade is fixed; do it in one
focused pass, build at the end):** add two base-case disjuncts AT THE END of the `ZPhi` Or-chain (after
the zK disjunct) so existing rcases patterns only need 2 appended cases:
```
  ∨ (∃ s p k, d = zAxAll s p k ∧ IsUFormula ℒₒᵣ p)   -- ∀-axiom leaf (tag 5)
  ∨ (∃ s p,   d = zAxNeg s p   ∧ IsUFormula ℒₒᵣ p)   -- ¬-axiom leaf (tag 6)
```
(IsUFormula in ZPhi so a rcased premise gives `IsUFormula p` for the §5 descent — `IsUFormula` is a
`𝚫₁-Predicate` in Foundation, `via isUFormula ℒₒᵣ`, usable in the blueprint.) Cascade to fix:
  - `ZPhi` def (~3165); `zphi_monotone` (~3173 rintro: +2 trivial leaf patterns, no `C` use);
    `zphi_strong_finite` (~3185: +2, leaves have no premise so `by simp`); `zphi_iff` (~3198, BOTH
    directions, bounded `∃ s<d,…`); `zblueprint` Σ AND Π cores (~3227, add `!zAxAllGraph d s p k ∧
    !isUFormula …` style disjuncts); `zPhi_definable` (~3247, add `zAxAll_defined.iff`,
    `zAxNeg_defined.iff`, `IsUFormula.defined.iff` to the simp).
  - 6 `rcases zDerivation_iff.mp` sites: lines ~3355, 3379, 3568, 3954 (`iord_descent_iR2_struct`),
    3972 (`iRedDescent_iR2_of_tp_isymR`), 4014 (`zAxReduct_of_ZDerivation`). Each: append 2 patterns
    `| ⟨s, p, k, rfl, hp⟩ | ⟨s, p, rfl, hp⟩`. For the descent lemmas the new leaf cases are tag 5/6:
    in `iord_descent_iR2_struct` they're NF (no descent needed — but htag excludes them, so `simp at
    htag`); in `iRedDescent_iR2_of_tp_isymR` tp=isymLk≠isymR so `absurd`; in `zAxReduct_of_ZDerivation`
    `zAxReduct (zAxAll…) = zAx1…` is NOT `= d`, so that lemma must WEAKEN — see below.
  - ⚠️ `zAxReduct_of_ZDerivation` becomes FALSE for the new leaves (`zAxReduct (zAxAll s p k) = zAx1 s p
    ≠ zAxAll s p k`). Restrict it to `tp d = isymR A → …` or to tags {0..4}, OR only use it on the
    i-side premise (which has `tp = isymR`, tag 1/2). Re-scope to `(htp : tp d = isymR A)`.
Then: with axioms now reachable as premises, assemble the K-case (steps 3–5 above) and the
unconditional descent.

## ⭐⭐⭐ Reflection — 2026-06-24 (lap 62, DEEP) — priorities reset

> Full synthesis: `REFLECTION-2026-06-24-lap62.md`. Direction **KEEP** (genuine forward motion — crux 1
> landed lap 57, 58–61 correctly built crux-2's axiom-clean ordinal engine). Three sharpenings below.

**Endpoint HARDENED (operator directive, binding):** axiom-free (trust base only) **or abandoned**. No cited
`PRWO→Con` axiom on the headline; `PA_delta1Definable` must also be discharged. Crux 2 reclassified
🟠-generational → **🟡 must-fully-discharge frontier** (feasibility settled: Bryce–Goré Coq, Feb 2026).

**KEEP:** Route A; crux 2 via **Buchholz-Z + C0.5 bridge** (fork B, judge-endorsed); the axiom-clean
`InternalZ` engine; `GentzenCon` SEAM guards; the banked `peano_not_proves_TI` monument (do NOT touch).

**STOP:** crux-2-as-cited-axiom as an endpoint (forbidden); refining `#`/tower/template algebra *before* the
OBJECTS exist; the `GentzenCon` footer's "arithmetize over Foundation's `Theory.Derivation`" plan (superseded
by Buchholz-Z — re-point that footer next edit).

**HIGHEST-VALUE NEXT (objects-first, in order):**
1. **Fixpoint `ZDerivation : V → Prop`** — THE unblocker (lap-61 NEXT #1, confirmed). Mirror Foundation's
   `Theory.Derivation` via `HFS/Fixpoint.lean`'s `Fixpoint.Construction` over the `z*` codes
   (`InternalZ.lean`). Unblocks structural induction (`isNF (iõ d)`), `iR` well-definedness, the
   ⊥-characterization, and per-rule C3 instantiation.
2. **`iR : V → V`** (C2 reduction `d ↦ d[0]`) — needed to state the per-rule descent on concrete reducts.
3. **C0.5 Foundation→Z bridge** — `(𝗣𝗔).DerivationOf d ⊥ → ∃ z, ZDerivesEmpty z` (M-internal). Type written
   in `InternalZ.lean` footer; blueprint = Bryce–Goré `Peano.v` (filed `ON-LINE-REQUEST` for the source).
4. **C3 descent — REORDERED per judge `E-CRUX2-DECOMPOSITION-2026-06-24.md` (2026-06-24).** The difficulty
   is NOT spread across iR+C3; it is concentrated in **ONE case (5.1, critical/cut-elim)**, gated behind two
   currently-unlisted prereqs. Plow in this order (most are low-hanging `#`-bookkeeping the algebra exists for):
   - **iR skeleton** (rule-by-rule dispatch on `zTag`, Def 3.2) — minimal, enough for the easy rules.
   - **LOW-HANGING descent cases first** (each ~1 lap; debugs the engine end-to-end before the nut):
     LH1 I¬ (`self_lt_iadd_one`), LH2 I∀ (+ subst-invariance `õ(d(a/t))=õ(d)`), LH3 chain-non-crit (**F1**),
     LH4 Ind (**F3** `ω^β·k≺ω^{β+1}`), LH5 chain-crit (**F1+F2**).
   - **THEN two prereqs (build before the nut — without them C3-critical can't be STATED truthfully, only
     smuggled as a `rk(A(d))<dg(d)` hypothesis = hidden gap):** **L3.1** Lemma 3.1 critical-pair existence
     (pure Σ₁ combinatorics on premise list, NO ordinals); **T3.4** Theorem 3.4 `rk(A(d))<r` + the `d{0}`/`d{1}`
     auxiliary derivations. ⚠️ CHECK FIRST (judge pt-7): if the box's rank encoding makes `rk<r` definitional,
     T3.4 collapses to an unfolding — don't over-build it.
   - **THE NUT (case 5.1, Lemma 4.1(b)(ii)):** mostly OBJECT construction (build `d{0}`/`d{1}` as ZDerivations
     per 3.2(5.1)) + a 3-step ordinal tail: F2 (`õ(d[0])<ω^{õ(d)}`) + degree-drop (`dg(d[0])<dg(d)` via T3.4)
     + the tower combine. ✅ **The tower step is BANKED:** `InternalTower.iotower_omega_pow`
     (`ω_m(ω^α)=ω_{m+1}(α)`, proved lap 62) + `icmp_iotower_lt_succ_of_le` give exactly the §4 combine.
   - **Thm 4.2** = ~3-line tower combine over LH-cases + nut.
   - Lit map: nut → `papers/buchholz-beweistheorie-lecture-notes.pdf` + `buss-handbook-ch2`; L3.1/T3.4 → [6] pp.8–9.

**PARALLEL FRONT (when crux-2 blocks):** discharge `PA_delta1Definable` upstream (now mandatory) — check the
Foundation pin first (still an `axiom` in `Incompleteness/Examples.lean`?). Also **C0.5 bridge** decomposes
into B1 (PA axioms→Z) / B2 (PA rules→Z, **induction via Z's native `Ind` rule — the key shortcut**) / B3
(compose, M-internal). ⭐ Judge §5 (2026-06-24): the `Ind` shortcut SKIPS Bryce–Goré's induction→ω-rule
sub-tower (~half their `Peano.v`) ⟹ **C0.5 is <1k lines**, not ~1215. Do NOT port their `cut_elim.v`
(infinitary, not the primrec `R` PRWO needs); only `Peano.v` transfers. Run in a worktree when descent stalls.

> **Lap-62 progress (this lap):** C0 Fixpoint `ZDerivation` ✅ DONE (structural skeleton + `case` +
> `induction`, axiom-clean `wip/InternalZ.lean`); nut tower step `iotower_omega_pow` ✅ banked (`src/`).
> NEXT = `iR` rule-by-rule skeleton → 5 low-hanging cases.

**HYGIENE (low, non-blocking):** off-path `DescentSemantic.lean` free-X `sorry` + deps → `wip/` candidates.

## ⭐⭐ Lap 59 — natural-sum `#` NF + order foundations DONE; ORDER>iC reprioritization

`wip/InternalNadd.lean` (the lap-58 brick 1) now carries, all `lake env lean` green + axiom-clean
`[propext,choice,Quot.sound]`:
- **NF preservation:** `isNF_insTerm` (`isNF e→n≠0→isNF b→isNF (insTerm e n b)`), `isNF_inadd`
  (`isNF a→isNF b→isNF (inadd a b)`). Order-induction; the `isNF_ocOadd` side-condition (lead-exp `≺`
  head) discharged through the 3 `insTerm_ocOadd` branches via `icmp_two_iff_swap_zero` / `icmp_eq_imp_eq`
  / `ocExp_insTerm`.
- **Unit/prepend laws:** `insTerm_prepend` (`insTerm e n b = ocOadd e n b` when `b=0 ∨ icmp (ocExp b) e=0`),
  `inadd_zero_right` (`#` right-unit on NF).
- **ω-power layer:** `thenV_one_right`, `icmp_omega_pow` (`icmp (ω^α)(ω^β)=icmp α β`; `ω^c=ocOadd c 1 0`),
  `inadd_omega_pow` (`ω^α # b = insTerm α 1 b`).

**⚠️ REPRIORITIZATION (this lap's finding):**
1. **ORDER, not iC, is what the descent consumes.** Buchholz Thm 4.2 (`o(d[n]) ≺ o(d)`) via Lemma 4.1
   (`dg`/`õ` monotonicity) needs `#`'s ORDER laws. `iC (a#b) ≤ iC a + iC b` is for ε₀-width control
   (crux-1 Grzegorczyk levels) and is NOT on the crux-2 descent path; at most it serves C4 bounds.
2. **`iC_inadd` does NOT follow from the naive `insTerm`-fold.** `iC (insTerm e n b) ≤ max(iC e)(n+iC b)`
   (or `n+max(iC e)(iC b)`) is provable, but folding it over `a`'s terms over-counts: `inadd (ocOadd ec nc
   rc) b = insTerm ec nc (inadd rc b)` adds `nc` to the WHOLE accumulator `iC(inadd rc b) ≥ iC rc`,
   giving `nc+iC rc` where `iC a` only has `max(iC ec)nc` maxed with `iC rc`. The TRUE bound needs the NF
   fact `ec ≻ (every exp of rc)` so the `nc`-merge can only hit a `b`-coefficient (≤ iC b), never an
   rc-term. ⟹ a real NF-aware proof, deferred until/unless C4 needs it.

**Buchholz §4 inequalities NOW PINNED** (read `scratchpad/buchholz-gentzen.txt:781-822`). Lemma 4.1 /
Thm 4.2: every descent case rewrites `õ(d)=ω^{α0}#…#ω^{αl}` by replacing ONE summand `ω^{αi}` with a
strictly-smaller block, then concludes the whole `#` drops. The `#`-facts actually consumed:
- **(F1) `#` strict left-cancellation/mono** — replacing a summand by a smaller one decreases the sum.
- **(F2) two-powers-below** — `αi0,αi1 ≺ αi → icmp (ω^{αi0} # ω^{αi1}) (ω^{αi}) = 0`  (case 5.1, 5.2.1).
- **(F3) `ω^β·k ≺ ω^{β+1}`** — `icmp (ocOadd β k 0) (ω^{β+1}) = 0`, finite k (case 4, the Ind rule).
- **(F4) commutativity** of `#` (to move the changed summand to the cancellable end) + assoc for the fold.

**NEXT deep target (hardest-first) = (F1), now SHARPLY ISOLATED.** This lap recast it:
`#` strict-mono ⟺ **left-cancellation `icmp (inadd g X) (inadd g Y) = icmp X Y`** (NF g,X,Y), which by
order-induction on `g` (using `inadd_ocOadd` + `inadd_single_term`, banked) reduces to the **single-term
insertion embedding**:
> **`icmp_insTerm_congr` (NF A, NF B): `icmp (insTerm e n A) (insTerm e n B) = icmp A B`.**  ← THE nut.
Proof plan = pair order-induction on `m=⟪A,B⟫` (mirror `icmp_swap_aux`/`icmp_eq_imp_eq`), motive
`isNF (π₁ m)→isNF (π₂ m)→ …`. Case grid on `icmp e (ocExp A)`×`icmp e (ocExp B)` (∈{0,1,2}) + A/B=0:
  - both-prepend (e≻ both leads): heads `ω^e·n` equal, tails are A,B ⟹ `icmp_ocOadd` + `icmp_self` +
    `cmpV_self` collapse to `icmp A B`.
  - both-merge (e=both leads): coeffs `n+ca`,`n+cb`; **`cmpV_add_left`** (banked) ⟹ `cmpV ca cb`; tails
    `ra,rb` unchanged ⟹ `icmp A B` directly (`icmp_pos_pos`).
  - both-recurse (e≺ both leads): heads `ω^{la}·ca` vs `ω^{lb}·cb` decide unless la=lb∧ca=cb, then
    **IH on ⟪ra,rb⟫** (both `< m`). Heads match `icmp A B`'s head exactly.
  - mixed (e relates differently to la vs lb): then la≠lb (NF + e between them), so BOTH `icmp A B` and the
    inserted comparison are decided by the lead-exponent comparison la-vs-lb — they agree. (Lean: case on
    which of the 6 mixed combos; each resolves at the head via `icmp_pos_*`/`icmp_finHead_infHead`-style.)
  - base A=0 (B≠0, so `icmp A B=0`): need `icmp (ω^e·n) (insTerm e n B)=0`, i.e. ω^e·n ≺ insertion into a
    nonzero NF B. Sub-lemma `insTerm_ge_term` (dominance). Symmetric for B=0.
Then **(F1)** `inadd_left_cancel` (induct g) ⟹ strict-mono corollary `icmp X Y=0 → icmp(g#X)(g#Y)=0`.
**(F2)/(F3)** are short once `icmp_omega_pow` + `icmp_ocOadd` are in hand (F3 = exponent compare `β≺β+1`;
F2 = both exps `≺ αi` ⟹ 2-term CNF below `ω^{αi}`). **(F4)** commutativity = the other hard nut (NF
canonical-form uniqueness); defer behind (F1) since (F1)+reorder often suffices per-case.
- ALT (worktree, parallel if a lap stalls): start C0 (arithmetize system Z `ZDerivation : V→Prop`),
  independent of the `#` order algebra.

## ⭐⭐⭐ Lap 58 — crux 2 REFRAMED to model-theoretic route + Buchholz ord/R GROUNDED from source

**(a) `gentzen_reduction_internalized` is now a THEOREM** (`21a7318`). Was an opaque object-level axiom
`𝗣𝗔 ⊢ (prwoInstance gentzenDescentφ 🡒 Con(𝗣𝗔))`; now proved via `provable_of_models 𝗣𝗔` +
`Semantics.Imp.models_imply` + `Bootstrapping.consistent.defined`, from the clean **per-model semantic
axiom** `gentzen_descent_of_inconsistent` (Gentzen eq-(5) at model level: `¬𝗣𝗔.Consistent M` ⟹ the
gentzen descent everywhere `icmp`-descends in `M`). Same axiom COUNT (4) but the deep one is now in the
proven crux-1 shape. Assembly `#print axioms` = `[propext,choice,Quot.sound,PA_delta1Definable]` + 4.

**(b) Buchholz `ord`/`R` extracted VERBATIM** → `CRUX2-ORD-ASSIGNMENT-2026-06-24.md` (text in
`scratchpad/buchholz-gentzen.txt`). `o(d) := ω_{dg(d)}(õ(d))`; `õ`/`dg` recursions (I∀/I¬/Ind/K rules);
consistency = ⊥-derivation ⟹ `tp=Rep` ⟹ infinite `o`-descent (Thm 4.2) ⟹ ¬PRWO.

**(c) ⚠️ LOAD-BEARING FINDING — calculus mismatch.** Buchholz's `ord`/`R` are over **his system Z**
(chain rule `K^r`, `Ind`, `Rep`/`tp`/`d[n]` ω-simulation), NOT Foundation's **Tait+cut** calculus
(`Theory.Derivation`: `axL`/`andIntro`/…/`cutRule`/`axm`). Foundation's `Hauptsatz` is **meta-level**
(Type `⊢ᵀ Γ` realizability, no arithmetized ordinals) — no shortcut. ⟹ **Route A** (recommended):
arithmetize system Z + a translation `𝗣𝗔-Tait-⊥-deriv → Z-⊥-deriv`. Route B (Schütte on Tait+cut directly)
fails because PA-induction is an `axm` schema that blocks finite cut-elim. Full analysis in the doc.

**NEXT (hardest-first, concrete + checkable, all Route A):**
1. **InternalONote natural (Hessenberg) sum `#`** — the ONE genuinely-missing ordinal primitive `õ` needs
   (`ω^c` = `ocOadd c 1 0`; ω-tower `ω_n` = meta-iterate of `c↦ocOadd c 1 0`; `iadd`/`iomul`/`ibigMul`
   already exist). Source-independent, bounded — the best first brick. Build `inadd a b` (CNF merge of
   exponents summing coeffs) + `isNF_inadd`/`icmp_inadd`/`iC_inadd` (mirror `iadd`).
2. **C0 — arithmetize system Z** as `ZDerivation : V → Prop` (`Fixpoint.Construction`, mirror
   `Theory.Derivation`); coded `zI∀`/`zI¬`/`zInd`/`zK`+atomic, `fstIdx`/subterm-`<` lemmas; formula `rk`.
3. **C1 — `iõ`/`idg`/`iord`** by `<`-strong-recursion on Z-codes (recursion combinator: build the
   derivation analog of Foundation `Language.TermRec.Construction` (`Term/Basic.lean:301`), or graph-Fixpoint).
4. **C2/C3** — `iR := d↦d[0]`, preserves-⊥; Thm 4.2 internalized (Lemma 4.1 `dg`/`õ` monotonicity). Deep.
5. **C5** — `gentzenDescentφ` graph + `d₀` via the Route-A translation of `𝗣𝗔.Proof _ ⌜⊥⌝`.
First action next lap: build brick 1 (`inadd`) in a new `src/GoodsteinPA/InternalNadd.lean` (or extend
`InternalCor34`), sorry-free + axiom-clean, mirroring the existing `iadd` lemma set.

**BRICK 1 EQUATIONAL CORE DONE (lap 58, `wip/InternalNadd.lean`, `lake env lean` green, axiom-clean
`[propext,choice,Quot.sound]`).** Natural sum factored into two single-arg course-of-values recursions
(mirroring `iomul`/`iadd`): `insTerm e n b` (insert `ω^e·n` into NF `b`; `insTerm_ocOadd` 3-way `icmp`
recursion) and `inadd a b = insTerm (ocExp a)(ocCoeff a)(inadd (ocTail a) b)` (`inadd_ocOadd`,
`inadd_zero_left`). Both `𝚺₁`-definable (full `*_defined`/`*_definable`/`*_definable'` instances + tables).
Gotchas banked: open `LO.FirstOrder.Arithmetic.HierarchySymbol` for `DefinableFunction₂/₃.comp`/
`Definable.comp₁`/`ball_le`; for a 2-param `PR.Blueprint`, `resultDef` natural order is
`(result, index, param₀, param₁)` so `insTermTableDef := …resultDef.rew (Rew.subst ![#0,#3,#1,#2])`
(index↦last). **NEXT for brick 1 (the property lemmas, then promote to `src/`):** `isNF_insTerm`/
`isNF_inadd` (NF preservation), `icmp`-monotonicity (`# ` is commutative + strictly-monotone in each arg
on NF), `iC_inadd` (`iC (a # b) ≤ iC a + iC b` or similar), and `inadd`-commutativity. These are what
`õ`'s descent (Lemma 4.1) consumes. Mirror the `iadd`/`iomul` `isNF_*`/`icmp_*`/`iC_*` proof style
(`InternalONote.lean` ~1820–2100).

**HELPERS DONE (lap 58 cont., `wip/InternalNadd.lean` green):** `icmp_tri` (comparison code is always
`0`/`1`/`2`, order-induction via `cmpV_tri`/`thenV_tri`) + `icmp_eq_zero_of_ne`; `insTerm_pos`/
`insTerm_ne_zero`; `ocExp_insTerm` (head exp `= e` unless `e ≺ lead-exp b`, then `ocExp b`). V-numeral
disequalities (`0≠1`,`0≠2`,…) discharge by `simp`. **NEXT: `isNF_insTerm`** (`isNF e → n≠0 → isNF b →
isNF (insTerm e n b)`) by order-induction on `b`: the `e≺e'` branch needs `icmp (ocExp(insTerm e n r')) e'
= 0`, supplied by `ocExp_insTerm` (lead-exp is `e` or `ocExp r'`, both `≺ e'`). Then `isNF_inadd`,
`icmp`-monotonicity, `iC_inadd`.

## ⭐⭐ Lap 57 — TWO findings: (a) seqDescent_dominated was FALSE, fixed; (b) width-code wall

**(a) Soundness fix (DONE, committed `38c6de0`).** Lap-56's `seqDescent_dominated` was **false at ℕ**
(conclusion `SeqDominated` asserts an infinite ε₀-descent; hyps vacuously met by empty seq). Fixed by
threading an explicit realizer `SeqRealized seq M = ∃ β:M→M, (∀n, M⊧/![β n,n] seq) ∧ NF ∧ ≠0 ∧ 𝚺₁`,
discharging the β-parts of `SeqDominated` directly. New disclosed axiom `gentzenDescentφ_realized`. See
memory `seqdominated-vacuity-needs-realizer`.

**(b) THE sharpened crux-1 target — `BlkRec`-over-function refactor (see
`ANALYSIS-2026-06-23-lap57-width-code-wall.md`).** The remaining `seqDescent_dominated` gap is NOT
"build a finite width code `wseq`" — **no finite `wseq` works**. `nonterminating_of_slowdown` needs the
slow-down NF+`iC≤k+1`+descent for ALL `k:V`; a finite `wseq` gives `znth=0` past `lh` ⟹ `blk wseq j ∼ j`
⟹ `iC(β(blk j)) ≤ Cβ+j` fails for complexity-growing descents (exactly Cor 3.4's case). **Fix:** width as
a `𝚺₁` FUNCTION `W := fun t => iC(β(t+1))` (mirrors `Grz.corW`). Refactor steps:
1. `src/BlkRec.lean`: add `blkF W`/`offF W` (𝚺₁ `boState` recursion reading `W (π₁ ih)`), re-prove the 4
   bookkeeping facts + width-sum facts + internal `C_le_wsumc` (= `Grz.C_le_wsum_corW`). Additive → green.
2. `src/StdCor34.lean`: `crux1_internal_run_of_width_dom` etc. switch `BlkRec.blk wseq`→`blkF W`; width
   hyp becomes `∀n, W n ≤ iF l₀ n`; `hβC` via `C_le_wsumc`.
3. `wip/GentzenCon.lean` `SeqDominated`: `wseq Cβ : M` → `W : M→M`; `seqDescent_dominated` then discharges
   fully (`Cβ:=iC(β 0)`, `l₀':=l₀+1`, width-dom from `hβbound`). No remaining width gap.

This is hardest-first crux-1 work; the descent half is already general (works for any width).
**Step 1 DONE (`21d1856`):** `src/GoodsteinPA/BlkRecF.lean` — `blkF`/`offF`/`wsumcF` over a width
FUNCTION, sorry-free + axiom-free. **Step 2 DONE (`2f8f72e`):** `src/GoodsteinPA/StdCor34F.lean` —
`crux1_internal_run_F` drives the internal run over the width function, C-bound + within-block
domination discharged internally (`iC_le_wsumcF`, `one_le_iC_of_ne_zero`); no `hβC`/`Cβ`/`wseq`.
**Step 3 DONE (`2199982`) — CRUX 1 CLOSED.** `wip/GentzenCon.lean` `nonterminating_of_seq_descent` calls
`StdCor34F.crux1_internal_run_F` directly (clean `[propext,choice,Quot.sound]`); dead finite-`wseq` girder
gone. `SeqRealized` carries explicit `βDef`; `SeqStdBounded` width form. **The crux-1 sorry is gone.**

## ⭐⭐ WHOLE Gentzen chain now SORRY-FREE (`abece0f`). NEXT = crux 2 = 4 disclosed axioms (🟠 generational)
`wip/GentzenCon.lean` sorry-free; `goodstein_implies_consistency_via_gentzen` `#print axioms` =
`[propext, choice, Quot.sound, PA_delta1Definable]` + 4 crux-2 axioms. Crux 1 axiom-clean. The remaining
4 (all the Gentzen ordinal-analysis arithmetization, interlocked):
- `gentzenDescentφ` (ℒₒᵣ graph of `n↦ord(Rⁿd₀)`), `gentzenDescentφ_realized` (total 𝚺₁ NF branch +
  explicit `βDef`), `gentzenDescentφ_dominated` (Rathjen 3.2 width bound) — discharge once `ord`/`R` exist.
- `gentzen_reduction_internalized : 𝗣𝗔 ⊢ (prwoInstance gentzenDescentφ 🡒 Con(𝗣𝗔))` — Gentzen's
  `PRWO(ε₀) → Con(𝗣𝗔)` internalized; the deep `TI(ε₀) ⊢ Con(PA)` content.
Attack: (a) read Buchholz (`papers/buchholz-on-gentzens-first-consistency-proof.pdf`) + `papers/siders-*`,
decompose eq-(5) `ord(R d) ≺ ord d` lemma-by-lemma; (b) state `ord`/`R` as `ℒₒᵣ` primrec functions over
Foundation's `Theory.Derivation` (`Bootstrapping/Syntax/Proof/Basic.lean`); (c) certificates then
discharge from `ord`/`R`'s fixed build tree. Multi-lap. Headline stays `sorry` until all 4 real.

## Lap 56 — crux-1 redirect: natCode↔NF bridge DISSOLVED (transparent icmp); over-generality sharpened

**FRESH-MIND REVIEW. Build green 1315; headline honest sorry; M1+Phase 1 done; faithfulness clean.
Direction VALIDATED** (crux 1 right hardest-but-tractable target; crux-2 eq-5 stays 🟠 parked). Two
crux-1 findings, both acted on (`wip/GentzenCon.lean`, verified `lake env lean` green; memory
`prwo-transparent-icmp-not-opaque-precphi`):

**(1) DONE — opacity dissolved.** Lap-55 built `prwoInstance` on `SeamDefinability.precφ` =
`codeOfREPred₂ (natCode a < natCode b)`, Foundation's **opaque r.e. blob** whose spec is std-model-ONLY;
in nonstandard `M`, `M⊧/![z,y]precφ` is an opaque Σ₁ search, NOT cleanly `z≺y` — re-creating the wall-B
opacity lap 36 dissolved. **Fix (mirrors lap 36):** rebuilt on the transparent internal `icmp`:
- `prec_internal : Semisentence ℒₒᵣ 2 := “z y. ∃ c, !icmpDef c z y ∧ c = 0”`
- `eval_prec_internal : M⊧/![z,y]prec_internal ↔ icmp z y = 0` (every `M⊧IΣ₁`; `simp [prec_internal,
  Semiformula.eval_substs, icmp_defined.iff]`).
- `prwoInstance`/`prwoInstance_models_iff`/`prwoInstance_faithful` (now `M=ℕ` corollary) all on `icmp`,
  axiom-clean `[propext,choice,Quot.sound]` — `_faithful` even SHED its F-φ `native_decide` artifact.
- `ord_R_descends`/`gentzenDescent_descends` switched to `icmp` form for coherence.
⟹ **the natCode↔NF order bridge (lap-55's "new sub-target") DISSOLVES**: `nonterminating_of_seq_descent`'s
descent hyp is ALREADY `∀ n y z, seq[y,n]→seq[z,n+1]→icmp z y=0`, the exact `icmp`-descent form
`StdCor34.crux1_internal_run_of_width_dom` consumes (`hβdesc`). PRWO + `igoodstein` now share ONE coding.
`goodstein_implies_prwo` clean modulo the lone bridge sorry.

**(2) THE concrete next target — standard-level domination certificate.** `nonterminating_of_seq_descent`
for *arbitrary* `seq` (no domination hyp) is **UNPROVABLE on the built standard girder**:
`crux1_internal_run_of_width_dom` needs a STANDARD `l₀:ℕ` with `∀ n, znth wseq n ≤ iF l₀ n`, but
`Grz.F_diag_not_dominated` kills standard domination of a diagonal-fast descent (lap-55 flagged this;
confirmed). **Attack paths (do one next lap):**
- **(A, recommended) Thread the certificate.** Add to `nonterminating_of_seq_descent` a hypothesis
  packaging the Cor-3.4 slowdown inputs derived from `seq` — concretely `∃ (β:M→M)(wseq Cβ:M)(l₀:ℕ),
  0<l₀ ∧ (∀n,isNF(β n)) ∧ (∀n,β n≠0) ∧ (∀n,icmp(β(n+1))(β n)=0) ∧ (∀j,iC(β(blk wseq j))≤Cβ+j) ∧
  𝚺₁-Function₁ β ∧ (∀n,znth wseq n≤iF l₀ n)`. Then the proof is `obtain ... ; exact
  crux1_internal_run_of_width_dom ...` — **discharges the sorry**. (Requires `wip/GentzenCon` to import
  `wip/StdCor34`.) Thread the certificate up through `prwoInstance_models_of_goodstein` /
  `goodstein_implies_prwo`; supply it at `gentzenDescentφ` in the assembly as a disclosed axiom (Lemma 3.2,
  discharged once `ord`/`R` exist). This makes the chain HONEST (no unprovable general lemma).
- **(B) Construct β from seq's value-graph.** The β for the girder = `seq`'s value function (the unique `y`
  with `seq[y,n]`); needs `seq` functional/total + NF nonzero values. Then `hβdesc` = the descent hyp
  directly. This is the seq→β extraction half of the construction; pairs with (A) for the wseq half.
- **(C) Build the seq→wseq Cor-3.4 slowdown** (the deep half: `InternalCor34.ibigMul`-standard lead +
  `Grzegorczyk.lean` blueprint; item 1 below). This is what eventually discharges the certificate for
  `gentzenDescentφ` rather than axiomatizing it.

**DONE later this lap (attack path A + honest threading):** Promoted `StdCor34` → `src/` (1316 jobs).
Wired `SeqDominated` + `nonterminating_of_dominated` (**axiom-clean** — certificate→girder seam type-checks
end-to-end). Then made the chain HONEST: `seqDescent_dominated` was a FALSE-for-arbitrary-seq sorry (its
conclusion `SeqDominated M` is seq-free, so "any descent ⟹ a standard-dominated descent exists" is false —
`F_diag`). Fixed by threading the seq-specific **`SeqStdBounded seq M := ∃ l₀:ℕ, ∀ n y, seq[y,n] → iC y ≤
iF l₀ n`** (Rathjen Lemma 3.2) through `seqDescent_dominated` / `prwoInstance_models_of_goodstein` /
`goodstein_implies_prwo` (now `(hstdom : ∀ M⊧IΣ₁, SeqStdBounded seq M) → 𝗣𝗔⊢γ → 𝗣𝗔⊢prwoInstance seq`),
supplied at `gentzenDescentφ` by the disclosed axiom `gentzenDescentφ_dominated`. **Result:**
`seqDescent_dominated` is now a TRUE conditional lemma; its sorry = the genuine Cor-3.4 construction (β from
seq's descending branch + the standard-level slowdown using `hstdom`). **THE crux-1 next target** = prove
`seqDescent_dominated` (paths B/C above). NB its hardest input (`hstdom` for `gentzenDescentφ`) is gated on
crux 2's `ord`/`R` arithmetization, so the independent crux-1 work is the GENERAL construction
(`seqDescent_dominated` for an abstract `SeqStdBounded` descent).

## ⭐ Lap 55 — crux-1 frontier collapsed to TWO clean inputs + the model-theoretic route for `goodstein_implies_prwo`

**Done this lap (all axiom-clean `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`, src build green 1315):**
- **`hdef` (definability) FULLY DISCHARGED.** `src/InternalIg`: `ig0_definable`, `ig_definable`
  (meta-induction on level, proved at `𝚺₁`), `igtTot_definable`. `wip/StdCor34`: `bbtail_definable`,
  `bbeta_definable`, `salpha_definable`, then **`hdef_of_beta_definable`** (the whole `bbeta∘salpha`
  tower is `𝚺₁`-definable from a single `𝚺₁-Function₁ β` premise) and **`crux1_internal_run_of_beta_def`**.
- **`hdom` reduced to clean WIDTH-domination.** `BlkRec.off_succ_lt_width_of_blk_eq` (within a block the
  offset is strictly below the width) + `StdCor34.hdom_of_width_dom` + **`crux1_internal_run_of_width_dom`**:
  the domination premise is now just `∀ n, znth wseq n ≤ iF l₀ n` (the concrete instance of Rathjen
  Lemma 3.2).
- **iF growth bricks (Lemma 3.2 substrate), `src/IIter`:** `self_le_iIter`/`self_le_iF` (inflationary
  `n ≤ iF l n`), `le_iIter_add` (iterate monotone in count), `iF_le_succ_level`/`iF_mono_level`
  (`l ≤ l' ⟹ iF l n ≤ iF l' n`, n≥1), `iF_one` (`iF 1 n = n + n`).

**Crux-1 frontier is now EXACTLY two inputs to `crux1_internal_run_of_width_dom`:**
  (a) a **definable ≺-descending NF `β`** and (b) **width-domination** `∀ n, znth wseq n ≤ iF l₀ n`.

**THE ROUTE for `goodstein_implies_prwo` (model-theoretic — ungates it from arithmetizing ord/R):**
Foundation has `LO.FirstOrder.complete_iff : T ⊨ φ ↔ T ⊢ φ` (`Completeness/Completeness.lean:69`). So
`𝗣𝗔 ⊢ prwoInstance seq` ⟺ `prwoInstance seq` holds in **every** model `V ⊧ 𝗣𝗔`. Proof of
`goodstein_implies_prwo`: from `𝗣𝗔 ⊢ γ` get (soundness) `𝗣𝗔 ⊨ γ`; for any `V ⊧ 𝗣𝗔`, `V ⊧ γ`; if
`V ⊭ prwoInstance seq` there is an internal infinite `seq`-descent ⟹ build `β` (NF ordinal codes from
the descent) + width-domination ⟹ `crux1_internal_run_of_width_dom` gives an internal non-terminating
Goodstein run = `V ⊭ γ`, contradiction. Hence `V ⊧ prwoInstance seq` ∀V ⟹ `𝗣𝗔 ⊢ prwoInstance seq` by
`complete_iff`. **No ord/R arithmetization needed for this skeleton** — the deep content moves into the
single per-model obligation "internal `seq`-descent ⟹ (NF `β` + standard-`l₀` width-domination)".
- The **width-domination is where the primrec-only restriction bites** (an arbitrary `seq`-descent may be
  diagonal-fast, undominable — `Grz.F_diag_not_dominated`). For the headline we only need the ONE concrete
  instance `seq = gentzenDescentφ`, whose width `C(ord(Rⁿd₀))` IS standard-`l₀` dominated by Lemma 3.2
  (see [[crux1-headline-needs-only-standard-level]]). So either (i) thread a standard-`l₀` domination
  hypothesis through `goodstein_implies_prwo`, or (ii) specialize it to descents with a domination
  certificate. NEXT LAP: set up the `complete_iff` skeleton in `wip/GentzenCon.lean`, isolating the
  per-model descent→β+domination obligation as the lone sorry.

## Reflection — 2026-06-23 (lap 53, DEEP) — direction KEEP; honest endpoint named
Full synthesis: `REFLECTION-2026-06-23-lap53.md`. Kernel re-verified (headline 0 math axioms, faithful
bridge clean, build green 1313). Route A **re-derived from the mathematics and KEPT** (Goodstein⟹PRWO,
not free-X-TI — §3 is primrec-only, the free-X bridge is the *wrong direction*, not merely hard).

- **DIRECTION CALL: KEEP.** Route A (Rathjen Cor 3.7) is correct and standard. The lap-52 NEXT (assemble
  `ig` + port g-properties + wire `StdCor34`) is the right next move.
- **KEEP doing:** drive **crux 1** (`goodstein_implies_prwo`, 🟡 tractable, ~80% built) to a clean
  axiom-free assembly — this is the hardest-first move among *resolvable* doubts and lands `γ→PRWO`
  axiom-clean, the next real milestone. Keep the `wip/GentzenCon.lean` scaffold + SEAM guards. Keep the
  banked Thm-5.6 monument (do not touch/resurrect/delete).
- **STOP doing:** (1) open-ended crux-1 substrate that isn't on the `ig → StdCor34.salpha →
  InternalThm35 → nonterminating_internal → goodstein_implies_prwo` critical path — every brick must
  answer "does this bring the `goodstein_implies_prwo` *body* closer?" (lap-49's generic-V `icorAlpha`
  tower failed that test and was banked). (2) Further crux-2 investment beyond the existing scaffold:
  crux 2 (`PRWO→Con`) is **🟠 GENERATIONAL** — arithmetizing Gentzen's `ord`/`R`/eq-(5) inside PA, with
  **no upstream shortcut** (confirmed lap 53: Foundation's `Hauptsatz.main` is meta-level; no arithmetized
  ordinal analysis in Foundation/mathlib; the meta-level Thm-5.6 machine can't be reused). The scaffold
  already isolates it to the single cited `ord_R_descends` axiom; chip only opportunistically.
- **HIGHEST-VALUE NEXT TARGET:** finish crux-1's `goodstein_implies_prwo` (the lap-52 NEXT list).
  Reasoning: it is the *resolvable* feasibility doubt, it de-risks half the headline with a concrete
  checkable win, and it crystallizes the honest endpoint — *crux-1 built + crux-2 cited eq-(5) +
  `PA_delta1Definable` upstream*, best-case headline `[propext, choice, Quot.sound, PA_delta1Definable]`.
- **FLAGGED FOR OPERATOR:** that best-case is NOT DIRECTION rule #1's strict trust base; the
  `PA_delta1Definable` cost is inherent to Route A's Gödel II. Recommendation: accept the single disclosed
  upstream axiom (orthogonal to the Goodstein mathematics). Needs a review/operator call before the
  headline `sorry` is ever discharged.

## ⭐⭐⭐ Lap 54 (cont.) — Cor 3.4 → Thm 3.5 internal chain ASSEMBLED end-to-end (modulo named hyps)
`wip/StdCor34.lean` now imports the promoted `GoodsteinPA.InternalIg` and assembles the real
internal-Grzegorczyk tail into the Thm-3.5 sequence (both axiom-clean `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`,
`lake env lean wip/StdCor34.lean` green; src build green 1315):
- **`salpha_igtTot_spec l₀ (hl₀ : 0 < l₀) …`** — instantiates `salpha (↑l₀) β blk off (igtTot l₀)` and
  proves the NF + (∃K, tight C-bound) + ≺-descent triple. The four unconditional `igtTot` props discharge
  `salpha_isNF`/`salpha_C_le` outright; `salpha_desc` reduces to the **single domination input** `hdom`
  (`∀ j, blk(j+1)=blk j → off j + 1 < iF l₀ (blk j)`) via `igtTot_within`.
- **`bbeta_of_igtTot …`** — feeds that triple into `InternalThm35.bbeta_isNF`/`bbeta_C_le`/
  `bbeta_desc_exists`, producing `∃ K s, 0<K ∧ NF ∧ iC(β'ᵣ)≤r+1 ∧ ≺-descent` — the complete Thm 3.5
  output (the input `DescentArith`/Lemma 3.6 consume).
- **`bbeta_of_igtTot_blkRec …`** — specializes `blk/off := BlkRec.blk/off wseq`, discharging the
  bookkeeping (`hblk_dich`/`hoff_adv`/`hnm`) directly from the src `BlkRec` laws. So the whole Cor 3.4
  → Thm 3.5 girder is now built from a single width code `wseq` + **just two deep inputs**: the input
  ≺-descending NF `β` and the domination `hdom` (`∀ j, blk(j+1)=blk j → off j + 1 < iF l₀ (blk j)`).

**`crux1_internal_run` — WHOLE girder chained to the non-terminating run (axiom-clean):** added the
seam to the Lemma-3.6 consumer. `nonterminating_of_bbeta_facts` repackages the `bbeta` triple as
`DescentSlowdown.nonterminating_of_slowdown`'s input (`iCanon (r+1) = iC ≤ r+1`, definitional).
`crux1_internal_run l₀ (0<l₀) wseq …` chains `igtTot → salpha → bbeta → Lemma 3.6` to
`∃ m₀, ∀ k, 0 < igoodstein m₀ k` (internal Goodstein run never terminates — the contradiction).
The ENTIRE internal-Grzegorczyk crux-1 girder is now machine-checked end-to-end, with the remaining gaps
isolated to exactly **three named hypotheses**:
1. **input `β`** (`hβNF`/`hβ0`/`hβdesc`/`hβC`) — the gentzen ε₀-descent as a ≺-descending NF V-sequence;
2. **`hdom`** — domination (Lemma 3.2): `off j + 1 < iF l₀ (blk j)`;
3. **`hdef`** — `𝚺₁`-definability of `bbeta K s (salpha (↑l₀) β (BlkRec.blk wseq) (BlkRec.off wseq)
   (igtTot l₀))` (∀ K s; uniform construction). STARTED (lap 54): the leaf instances
   **`iblk_definable`/`iblockIdx_definable`/`iblockOff_definable`** are now in `src/InternalIg` (explicit
   `DefinableFunction₂/₃.comp` terms — `definability` aesop blows its depth on the nested `ocOadd`/`iwseq`,
   per memory). **KEY UNLOCK still owed: an `ite`-definability lemma** (`fun x => if P x then f x else g x`
   definable from definable `P`,`f`,`g`) — Foundation has NO direct helper; build it via the graph
   disjunction `z = ite ↔ (P ∧ z=f) ∨ (¬P ∧ z=g)` as a `Defined` Semisentence. That unlocks
   `ig0`/`ig`(meta-induction on `l`)/`igtTot`/`bbtail` already-comp/`bbeta`/`icorAlpha`/`salpha`
   definability — the rest of the chain. NB `bbtail` is `iadd`/`iomul`/`ocOadd`/`/`/`%` comp (no ite);
   `bbeta` and `ig0`/`igtTot` are the ite ones; `ig` also needs meta-induction `∀ l, Function₂ (ig l)`.

**REMAINING crux-1 frontier (hardest-first), all now isolated as named hypotheses of `bbeta_of_igtTot`:**
1. **`hdom` = domination (Rathjen Lemma 3.2)**: `off j + 1 < iF l₀ (blk j)` — the within-block offset
   stays below the Grzegorczyk width. THE deep arithmetic brick; needs the specific input `β`/level `l₀`.
2. **`blk`/`off` bookkeeping + input `β`**: the `blk`/`off`/`hblk_dich`/`hoff_adv`/`hnm` come from
   `BlkRec` (in src); the raw ≺-descending NF `β` (`hβNF`/`hβ0`/`hβdesc`/`hβC`) is the gentzen-descent
   instance encoded as ε₀-codes — needs the descent-graph → V-internal-β bridge.
3. **Reflection lift**: from the V-internal descending sequence to the PA-provability statement
   `𝗣𝗔 ⊢ prwoInstance seq` (`wip/GentzenCon.lean:137` `goodstein_implies_prwo` `sorry`) via
   `DescentArith.nonterminating_internal` (needs Σ₁-definable `m`,`b` + internalized `ineq6_step`).
Inspect `src/GoodsteinPA/Domination.lean` (Dom ns) + `DescentSlowdown.lean` + `DescentArith` for (1)/(3).

## ⭐⭐ Lap 54 (cont.) — TOTALIZED `igtTot` (unconditional NF/≠0/exp/C), in-range within-descent
After the 5 raw `ig` props, built `igtTot l n m := if m < iF l n then ig l n m else ig0 0 0` and its
interface (all axiom-clean, `lake env lean wip/InternalIg.lean` green): `isNF_igtTot`, `igtTot_ne_zero`,
`higt_exp_igtTot`, `iC_igtTot_bound` are now **UNCONDITIONAL** (resolving the lap-53-flagged `higt0`
reconciliation — the `salpha_*` interface demands these ∀ n m, but raw `ig` is 0 out of range; the fixed
nonzero finite default `ig0 0 0 = ω^0·2` totalizes them). The within-block descent `igtTot_within`
(`m+1 < iF l n → icmp (igtTot (m+1))(igtTot m) = 0`) STAYS in-range — this is the single seam where
**domination (Lemma 3.2)** enters when wiring `salpha_desc`'s `higt_within` (offsets `< block width ≤
iF l (blk)`). So `igtTot` now satisfies ALL of `salpha_isNF`/`salpha_C_le` unconditionally, and
`salpha_desc` modulo the domination-backed within condition.

**NEXT (crux-1, hardest-first = DOMINATION):** the remaining deep brick is Rathjen **Lemma 3.2**: the
block-width `iC(β(t+1)) ≤ iF l₀ (blk)` for the specific `β` from `InternalThm35.bbeta` / the gentzen
descent, at a STANDARD level `l₀`. This is what makes every `salpha` offset in-range (feeds
`igtTot_within`). Until domination lands, the `salpha → bbeta → nonterminating_internal →
goodstein_implies_prwo` chain cannot close. Also still owed: the reflection/Δ₁ lift from the V-internal
`nonterminating_internal` machinery to the PA-provability statement `𝗣𝗔 ⊢ prwoInstance seq`
(`wip/GentzenCon.lean:137` `goodstein_implies_prwo` `sorry`) — a large separate layer. Inspect
`src/GoodsteinPA/Domination.lean` (`Dom` namespace, ℕ-level `toOrdinal`/`bump` bounds) + `InternalThm35`
for the β/level interface before attacking.

## ⭐⭐ Lap 54 — ALL 5 `igt`-interface props BUILT (`higt_within` + `higt0`, axiom-clean, wip)
The two remaining `StdCor34.igt` bricks landed in `wip/InternalIg.lean` (`lake env lean` green, full
`lake build GoodsteinPA` still green 1314; all axiom-clean `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`):
- **`higt_within` — THE deep brick** (`m < iF l n → icmp (ig l n (m+1)) (ig l n m) = 0`, internal
  `Grz.g_desc`). Meta-induction; base `icmp_ig0_desc`; step decomposes `m`'s block via the **new
  `iblock_step` dichotomy** (within: `iblockOff↦+1`, index fixed ⟹ `icmp_iblk_within` + IH with offset
  `< iF l (iIter…)` from `iblockOff_lt_width`; boundary: `iblockOff↦0`, index `+1` ⟹ coeff strict drop
  via `iblockIdx_lt` + monus arithmetic ⟹ `icmp_iblk_boundary`; exhaustion: `ig(m+1)=0 ≺` positive
  `iblk` via `icmp_zero_ocOadd`).
- Supporting generic bricks added (all in the `Support` section, generic `f`/`fDef`/`hf`):
  `iblockIdx_common`/`iblockOff_common` (prefix-invariance re-express `m`-state on the longer common
  code `iwseq…(m+1+1)` so the `BlkRec` step laws apply — the `m` vs `m+1` codes differ otherwise),
  `iblock_step` (`BlkRec.blk_off_within`/`_boundary`), `ipsum_le_add`/`ipsum_le_of_le` (monotonicity),
  `iter_le_ipsum_diag` (`Grz.F_succ_le_psum`), `iblockIdx_lt` (`Grz.blockIdx_lt`, by contradiction).
- **`ig_ne_zero` = `higt0`** (`m < iF l n → ig l n m ≠ 0`): `ig0`/`iblk` are `ocOadd…≠0`.

**5 of 5 igt props DONE: `isNF_ig`(higtNF), `higt_exp_ig`(higt_exp), `iC_ig_bound`(higtC),
`higt_within`, `ig_ne_zero`(higt0).** NEXT crux-1 step (no more `ig`-internal bricks): wire them into
`wip/StdCor34.lean` — `igt n m := ig l₀ n m`, supply the 5 hyps to `salpha_isNF`/`salpha_desc`/
`salpha_C_le`, then `salpha_*` → `InternalThm35.bbeta` → `DescentArith.nonterminating_internal`
(Lemma 3.6) ⟹ `goodstein_implies_prwo`. ⚠️ STILL OWED before claiming crux 1: (a) the `habove`/`iAbove`
input the `salpha_*` lemmas want (relate `ocExp (ig …)` to `iVbigMul (β…) (l+1)` — `higt_exp_ig` gives
the `< ω^(l+1)` shape; need the `iAbove` packaging); (b) reconcile the `salpha` `higt0` hyp being stated
UNCONDITIONALLY vs `ig_ne_zero` being in-range only (guard `igt` or weaken `salpha`); (c) the DEFERRED
`icmp`-code ↔ `natCode`-order seam; (d) the `off j < iF l₀ (blk j)` within-block hypothesis feeding
`higt_within` at the StdCor34 level.

## ⭐ Lap 53 (post-reflection grind) — `ig` recursion + structural invariants BUILT (axiom-clean)
Started the crux-1 `ig` assembly (the lap-52 NEXT). Two deliverables:
- **Promoted `InternalGrz` → `src/`** (sorry-free, axiom-clean since lap 52; charter says completed
  proofs live in `src/`). Build green **1314 jobs**. Added to the `GoodsteinPA.lean` aggregator.
- **NEW `wip/InternalIg.lean`** (compiles clean via `lake env lean`, all lemmas axiom-clean
  `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`):
  - `iF_pos : ∀ l x, 1 ≤ x → 1 ≤ iF l x` — positivity preservation of every meta-level (the `hfpos`
    input the `InternalGrz` decomposition laws need), by meta-induction via `iIter_pos`.
  - **`ig : ℕ → V → V → V`** — the internal Grzegorczyk `g` (mirror of `Grz.g`), meta-recursion on the
    standard level: `ig 0 = ig0`; `ig (l+1) n m = iblk (l+1) (max 1 (n - iblockIdx)) (ig l (iIter … n
    iblockIdx) iblockOff)` for `m < iF(l+1) n` else `0`. **Coefficient `max 1 (n - iblockIdx)` is the
    faithful internal mirror of Rathjen's `(n-blockIdx).toPNat'`** (`Grz.g` uses an `ℕ+` coeff) — equal
    to `n - iblockIdx` in the live regime, clamped to `1` out of range ⟹ NF holds unconditionally
    (sidesteps needing `iblockIdx < n` up front). Recurrence eqns `ig_zero`/`ig_succ_of_lt`/`ig_succ_of_ge`.
  - **`higt_exp_ig`** (internal `Grz.g_lt`, the `< ω^(l+1)` shape): `ocExp (ig l n m) = 0 ∨ ∃ j ≤ l,
    ocExp = ocOadd 0 j 0` — a DIRECT case analysis on the outermost constructor (NO induction; the top
    exponent is read off `ig0`/`iblk l`/`0`). This is the `StdCor34.habove_of_igt_exp` input (`higt_exp`).
  - **`isNF_ig : ∀ l n m, isNF (ig l n m)`** (internal `Grz.g_NF`, unconditional) — meta-induction;
    base `isNF_ig0`, step `isNF_iblk` (live coeff + NF tail via IH + tail nests below `ocOadd 0 (l+1) 0`
    via `higt_exp_ig`, discharged by `icmp_zero_ocOadd`/`icmp_ocOadd_lt_coeff`).

**`higtC` DONE (2nd lap-53 commit, axiom-clean):** `iC_ig_bound : ∀ l, ∃ Kg>0, ∀ n m, iC (ig l n m) ≤
Kg·(n+m+1)` (internal `Grz.g_C_bound`). Meta-induction; base `Kg=2` via `iC_ig0_le`, step `Kg=max ↑(l+1) K`
with the three `iC_iblk` pieces each `≤ Kg·(n+m+1)` — the clamped coeff `max 1 (n-bi) ≤ n+1` is FREE
(monus, no `iblockIdx < n` needed), the tail via the new supports `iIter_le_add_ipsum` +
`iter_add_iblockOff_le` (`tn+tm ≤ n+m`, internal `Grz.iter_add_blockOff_le`). The in-range branch derives
`1 ≤ n` (since `iF(l+1)0 = 0`). So 3 of 5 igt-interface props are built: **`higtNF`=`isNF_ig`,
`higt_exp`=`higt_exp_ig`, `higtC`=`iC_ig_bound`**.

**NEXT crux-1 bricks (remaining `StdCor34.igt` interface, hardest-first):**
1. **`higt_within` — `m < iF l n → icmp (ig l n (m+1)) (ig l n m) = 0`** (internal `Grz.g_desc`,
   `Grzegorczyk.lean:599`). The deep recursive within-block descent; meta-induction with within-block
   (`iblockOff → +1`, IH via `icmp_iblk_within`) vs block-boundary (`iblockOff → 0`, coeff drops via
   `icmp_iblk_boundary`) vs exhaustion (`ig (m+1) = 0`) cases. The hard port — needs internal
   `iblockIdx`/`iblockOff` step laws (`BlkRec.blk_succ_dich`/`off_succ_of_blk_eq` are the substrate).
2. **`higt0` — nonzero in range** (`m < iF(l+1)n → ig l n m ≠ 0`): `iblk`/`ig0` are `ocOadd … ≠ 0`.
   NB the `StdCor34` `higt0` hyp is stated unconditionally — reconcile (either guard `igt` to be nonzero
   everywhere, or weaken the `salpha_*` hyp to in-range; design call when wiring).
Then `igt n m := ig l₀ n m`, port the five into `higtNF`/`higt0`/`higt_within`/`higtC`/`higt_exp`, wire
`StdCor34.salpha_*` → `InternalThm35.bbeta` → `nonterminating_internal` ⟹ `goodstein_implies_prwo`.

## ⭐⭐⭐ Lap 52 — crux-1 bricks 1 + 2-core BUILT (green, axiom-clean, wip)
Discharged the two `wip/StdCor34` interface obligations' substrate (lap-51 designated NEXT):

- **Brick 1 DONE — `wip/BlkRec.lean`** (axiom-clean): the definable block bookkeeping `blk`/`off` as a
  single internal `𝚺₁` primitive recursion (`boStep` state machine: advance offset within a block,
  roll to next block when `off+1 ≥ W(blk)`) over an **abstract width sequence code `wseq`** (read by
  `znth wseq (blk j)`) — sidesteps internal `findGreatest`. Proves exactly the `StdCor34.salpha`
  bookkeeping hyps: `blk_succ_dich` (= `hblk_dich`), `off_succ_of_blk_eq` (within-block off-advance,
  behind `higt_within`), `blk_add_off_le` (= `hnm`) ⟹ `blk_le` (for `hβC`). Independent of β.

- **Brick 2 CORE DONE — `wip/IIter.lean`** (axiom-clean): the reusable internal-iterate primitive
  `iIter fDef f hf x c = f^[c] x` for a **fixed** `𝚺₁`-function `f` (graph `fDef`) at an **internal**
  count `c : V`, as a `PR.Construction` with both recurrence laws + `𝚺₁`-definability of `(x,c) ↦ f^[c]x`
  + `iIter_natCast` (standard `k` ⟹ meta-iterate `f^[k]`). This is the engine `iF (l+1) n = (iF l)^[n] n`
  needs (internal iteration at standard meta-level l ⟹ NO internal Ackermann).

**Brick 2 — `iF` + `ipsum` substrate DONE (`wip/IIter.lean`, axiom-clean); REMAINING = block-decomp + `ig`:**
- ✅ `iF : ℕ → (V → V)` built by meta-recursion (Subtype bundle `iFwith` carries function+Def+proof):
  `iF_zero`/`iF_succ`/`iF_defined` + `iF_natCast` (standard agreement `iF l ↑k = ↑(Grz.F l k)`).
- ✅ `ipsum f n i = Σ_{t=1}^i f^[t] n` (`Grz.psum` internalized): `ipsum_zero`/`ipsum_succ`/`ipsum_defined`
  + monotonicity. Generic over the fixed `𝚺₁`-fn `f`, so it serves every `iF l`.
- ✅ `wsumc` + `wsumc_blk_le` (`wip/BlkRec.lean`, codex review lap 52): the elapsed-WIDTH invariant
  `wsumc (blk j) ≤ j` that `salpha_C_le`'s `hβC` actually needs — `blk_le` (block count) alone was an
  OVERCLAIM. `wsumc_blk_add_off : wsumc(blk j) + off j = j` (exact, under positive widths).
- ⚠️ **wseq SEAM (codex lap 52):** `BlkRec.blk/off` read the width from a finite sequence CODE `wseq`
  (`znth wseq b`); the IIter substrate (`ipsum`) reads it from a definable width FUNCTION. For crux-1
  integration these must meet. Two routes: (a) build a concrete definable global width `W t = iC(β(t+1))`
  and thread its Def (couples `BlkRec` to β); (b) **prefix-invariance** — prove `blk wseq j` depends only
  on `znth wseq b` for `b ≤ blk j` (≤ j), so a *long-enough prefix code* of the true widths gives the
  correct `blk/off`. Route (b) keeps `BlkRec` abstract; add `blk_prefix_congr`/`off_prefix_congr` next.
- ⏭ NEXT: `iblockIdx`/`iblockOff` over `iF l` (level sets of `ipsum (iF l) n`). Mirror `Grz.blockIdx`/
  `blockOff` but AVOID internal `findGreatest` — use the `BlkRec.boStep` state-machine idiom (a width
  recurrence whose width at block `i` is `iIter (iFDef l) (iF l) (iF_defined l) n (i+1)`), giving
  `psum_blockIdx_le`/`blockOff_lt_width`/`psum_add_blockOff` internally. Needs `ipsum` monotonicity +
  a `≤ n` cap (blocks `< n`). Then `iF l`/`ipsum`/block-decomp standard-agreement lemmas as needed.
1. `ig : ℕ → V → V → V` meta-recursion: `ig 0 = ig0` (built), `ig (l+1) n m = iblk (l+1) (n - iblockIdx…)
   (ig l (iF l^[…] n) (iblockOff…))` for `m < iF (l+1) n` else 0 (mirror `Grz.g`). Port `g_NF`/`g_lt`/
   `g_desc`/`g_C_bound`/`g_exp` ⟹ the `StdCor34` `igt` interface (`higtNF`/`higt0`/`higt_within`/`higtC`/
   `higt_exp`). Then `igt n m := ig l₀ n m` for the Lemma-3.2 standard level `l₀`.
Then wire `BlkRec.blk/off` + `igt` into `StdCor34.salpha_*` → `InternalThm35.bbeta` → `DescentArith.
nonterminating_internal` (Lemma 3.6) ⟹ `goodstein_implies_prwo` body (crux 1).
⚠️ Then verify the DEFERRED DEEPER SEAM (`icmp`-code ↔ `natCode`-order) before claiming crux 1.

## ⭐⭐⭐ Lap 51 — SEAM CHECKS (operator-directed): crux-1↔crux-2 chain VERIFIED at statement level
Added 3 machine-checked guards to `wip/GentzenCon.lean` (compile iff the seams hold; green modulo the
2 disclosed crux sorries):
- **Seam 1 (ONE shared PRWO):** crux 1 *outputs* `𝗣𝗔 ⊢ prwoInstance gentzenDescentφ`, crux 2 *consumes*
  the same — the composition `gentzen_prwo_implies_consistency (goodstein_implies_prwo gentzenDescentφ ·)`
  type-checks ⟹ both reference the **identical** `prwoInstance` def (same `precφ` ε₀-order). ✓
- **Seam 2 (Con is Foundation's `Con[𝗣𝗔]`):** `example (hγ) : False := peano_not_proves_consistency
  (goodstein_implies_consistency_via_gentzen hγ)` type-checks ⟹ the assembly's `↑𝗣𝗔.consistent` is
  **definitionally** the object Gödel II (`consistent_unprovable 𝗣𝗔`) forbids — not a lookalike. ✓
- **Seam 3 (end-to-end = the girder):** `not_proves_of_implies_consistency
  goodstein_implies_consistency_via_gentzen : 𝗣𝗔 ⊬ ↑goodsteinSentence` — same type as `Reduction.lean`'s
  `goodstein_implies_consistency` girder; the assembly drops in once both crux sorries are real. ✓

**⚠️ ONE DEEPER SEAM STILL DEFERRED (verify when crux-1's BODY is wired):** the above guard seam 1 only
checks the prwoInstance *def* is shared between the two crux STATEMENTS. The crux-1 *proof*
(StdCor34 slow-down → `goodstein_implies_prwo`) works on `InternalONote` codes ordered by `icmp`/`isNF`;
but `prwoInstance`/`precφ` order the descent by `natCode` (`precφ_spec : ℕ⊧![m,n] precφ ↔ natCode m <
natCode n`). So wiring crux-1's body needs the bridge **`icmp a b = 0 ↔ natCode-order`** (and
`isNF`-code ↔ valid CNF notation) — i.e. that the StdCor34 descent β (icmp-code form) IS the descent
`prwoInstance gentzenDescentφ` quantifies over. This is the F-φ-flavoured code↔order seam; check it the
moment `goodstein_implies_prwo`'s sorry starts getting filled (ANTI-FRAUD: re-`#print axioms` the route).

## ⭐⭐⭐ Lap 51 — standard-level Cor 3.4 global assembly BUILT (green); crux-1 reduced to 2 concrete bricks
Followed the lap-50 designated next action. Two deliverables, both green:
- **`isNF_iadd_clean` + `isNF_icorAlpha`** (`src/InternalCor34.lean`, axiom-clean, in the build) — the
  missing NF sibling of `icmp_iadd_clean`/`iC_iadd_clean`. Completes the `icorAlpha` brick set: the
  slowed term `ω^(l+1)·β + g` now has ALL FOUR Cor-3.4 properties (within/boundary/C-bound/NF).
- **`wip/StdCor34.lean`** (type-checks at 400k heartbeats, off the build target) — the internal
  **global** Cor-3.4 assembly: `salpha_isNF` / `salpha_desc` / `salpha_C_le` prove that the slowed
  sequence `α j = ω^(l+1)·β_{blk j} + igt(blk j)(off j)` has `isNF` + global `icmp`-descent +
  `iC(α j) ≤ K·(j+1)` — **exactly the input `InternalThm35.bbeta` (Thm 3.5) consumes** — by composing
  the `icorAlpha_*` bricks. This is NEW non-vacuous content (the ℕ-template `Grz.corAlpha_*` only has
  the per-step lemmas; the global ∀j descent is vacuous in ℕ but real inside `V ⊧ 𝗜𝚺₁`).
  GOTCHA banked: `iadd`/`icorAlpha` are semireducible → `isDefEq` whnf-loops on variable-level args
  even on identical terms; `attribute [local irreducible] iadd icorAlpha` makes defeq structural.
  And `habove`'s 3rd arg feeds `β (blk a)`, so boundary leads `β(blk(j+1))`/`β(blk j)` need `a=j+1`/`a=j`
  (NOT `blk j+1`), keeping `salpha(j+1)` un-`hb`-rewritten.

**Crux 1 now reduces to discharging the `wip/StdCor34` interface hypotheses (2 concrete bricks):**
1. **Block bookkeeping `blk`/`off`** = internal `iwsum`/`iwidx`/`iwoff` (partial sums + `findGreatest`
   over the width fn `t ↦ iC(β(t+1))`), giving the dichotomy `blk(j+1) ∈ {blk j, blk j+1}`, the offset
   relations, and `blk j + off j ≤ j`. MECHANICAL `𝚺₁` recursion (mirror `Grz.wsum`/`widx`/`woff` +
   the PR.Construction idiom in `InternalCor34.iAboveTable`). Self-contained, axiom-clean-achievable.
2. **The `ig`-tail recursion `igt n m`** = internal Grzegorczyk `g` (`Grz.g`) at STANDARD level: NF /
   `≠0` / within-block descent / `iC ≤ Kg·(n+m+1)` / `iAbove(ocExp(igt n m)) (ω^(l+1)·…)`. Bottoms at
   `ig0`/`iblk` (built); the deep part is the meta-l recursion over the F-block decomposition, needing
   internal `iF_l` (standard l ⟹ fixed primrec, IΣ₁-total — NO internal Ackermann).
Then wire `salpha` → `bbeta` → `DescentArith.nonterminating_internal` (Lemma 3.6) → contradicts γ =
`goodstein_implies_prwo` (crux 1). **THE remaining hard wall stays crux-2 eq (5)** `ord(R d) ≺ ord d`.

## ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Lap 50 KEY INSIGHT — crux 1 for the HEADLINE needs only STANDARD level (internal-Ackermann wall is OFF-path)
Re-derived + paper-validated (Rathjen `scratchpad/rathjen.txt:401`, Lemma 3.2). Memory
`crux1-headline-needs-only-standard-level`. **This re-frames the project's hardest crux.**

- `goodstein_implies_consistency = crux2 ∘ crux1` uses crux 1 at the **single instance**
  `seq = gentzenDescentφ` (= graph of `n↦ord(Rⁿd₀)`), NOT for all primrec descents (PRWO is a schema).
- `H(n,d)=ord(R^[n]d)` is a **concrete** primrec function ⟹ Lemma 3.2 gives a **STANDARD** Grzegorczyk
  level `n₀` (PA-provable bound, independent of the internal arg `d₀`). `f_{n₀}` is then a fixed primrec
  fn, IΣ₁-total, evaluable at internal `d₀`. **No internal Ackermann.** The laps-45→49 internal-`l`
  conclusion was correct only for FULL PRWO (∀ internal-index descent) — the headline never needs that.
- ⟹ **crux 1 downgraded from generational to tractable engineering.** Build STANDARD-level internal
  Cor 3.4 (abstract over a descent with a STANDARD-l domination hyp `∃ l:ℕ, ∀n, C(β(n+1))≤f_l n`):
  * Reuse the ABANDONED standard lead `InternalCor34.ibigMul (k:ℕ)` + `ig0`/`iblk` (the lap-49 generic-V
    `iVbigMul`/`icorAlpha` tower was unneeded effort for the headline — keep banked, not on the path).
  * Blueprint = sorry-free ℕ-template `Grzegorczyk.lean` (`corAlpha`/`corAlpha_C_bound`/`_within`/`_boundary`,
    `g`/`g_desc`/`g_C_bound`, `F`).
  * Downstream DONE: internal Thm 3.5 (`InternalThm35.bbeta_*`), Lemma 3.6 (`DescentArith.nonterminating_internal`).
  * Discharge the standard-l domination for the gentzen descent via Lemma 3.2 once `ord`/`R` exist.
- **THE remaining hard wall is now crux 2's eq (5)** `ord(R d) ≺ ord d` (Gentzen reduction, Buchholz [6];
  Foundation Hauptsatz is meta-level only ⟹ from-scratch arithmetization). Crux 1 is no longer the bottleneck.
- ⚠️ NOT yet built/verified — validate the standard-level internal Cor 3.4 type-checks + `#print axioms`
  clean before relabeling crux 1 done.

**NEXT-LAP first action:** start `wip/StdCor34.lean` (or extend `InternalCor34`) — the standard-level
abstract Cor 3.4 over `ibigMul`, mirroring `Grz.corAlpha_*`. Then wire to `InternalThm35` + Lemma 3.6.

## ⭐⭐⭐ Lap 50 (2026-06-23) — REVIEW + crux-2 PRWO formulation BUILT & faithfulness-certified
Fresh-mind review. **Direction KEEP** (Route A = Rathjen Cor 3.7). Crux-1 step-3 (internal `ig`
f-recursion → internal Grzegorczyk `F`, Ackermann-level) is **blocked on infra Foundation lacks** —
so this lap advanced the *unblocked* **crux 2** (Gentzen `PRWO→Con`), per the lap-49 handoff.

**Foundation map (Explore, lap 50):** NO universal evaluator / Kleene-T predicate (`code`/
`codeOfPartrec'`/`codeOfREPred` all encode a *meta* function into a *fixed* formula). ⟹ **PRWO must be
a per-formula schema**, which is exactly what the proof needs (crux 1 proves all instances; crux 2 uses
the one for `n↦ord(Rⁿd₀)`). `Con(𝗣𝗔)` = `Theory.consistent : 𝚷₁.Sentence`; Gödel II =
`consistent_unprovable [T.Δ₁][𝗜𝚺₁⪯T][Consistent T]`; arithmetized derivations =
`Theory.Derivation : V→Prop` (`Bootstrapping/Syntax/Proof/Basic.lean:459`); Hauptsatz is **meta-level
only** (not arithmetized — no shortcut for eq 5). See memory `crux2-prwo-schema-no-universal-evaluator`.

**DONE this lap (`wip/GentzenCon.lean`, type-checks, 2 disclosed crux sorries):**
- `prwoInstance seq := “¬∀ n y z, (!seq y n ∧ !seq z (n+1)) → !precφ z y”` — reuses `SeamDefinability.precφ`
  (the ε₀-ordering ℒₒᵣ-formula); no `isNF` needed (`natCode : ℕ ≃ NONote` bijects onto all CNF).
- **`prwoInstance_faithful` PROVED** (`ℕ⊧prwoInstance seq ↔ ¬∀n y z, seq[y,n]→seq[z,n+1]→natCode z<natCode y`;
  axioms = trust base + 1 🟢 F-φ native_decide) — the formulation is **kernel-certified faithful**.
- `gentzenDescent_descends`/`derivesEmpty_iterate` PROVED (the `n↦ord(Rⁿd)` descent from `ord_R_descends`).
- assembly `goodstein_implies_consistency_via_gentzen` = `crux2 ∘ crux1` type-checks = the `Reduction.lean`
  girder interface (validates the architecture).

**NEXT — crux-2 deep cores (hardest-first), all in `wip/GentzenCon.lean`:**
1. **`ord_R_descends` (eq 5)** — THE Gentzen reduction ordinal-descent. Ground in Buchholz [6]
   (`papers/buchholz-on-gentzens-first-consistency-proof.pdf` + `siders-…pdf`). Hardest.
2. **`ord`/`R` as arithmetized primrec functions** over `Theory.Derivation` + `R_preserves_empty` +
   `gentzenDescentφ` (the ℒₒᵣ graph of `n↦ord(Rⁿd₀)`, `d₀`=least ⊥-proof).
3. **`gentzen_prwo_implies_consistency` (crux 2)** — assemble: `¬Con ⟹` derivation `d₀` of ⊥ ⟹ the
   `gentzenDescent` is an infinite ≺-descent ⟹ contradicts `prwoInstance gentzenDescentφ`. Needs the
   reasoning INSIDE 𝗣𝗔 (the `prwoInstance` must be applied to the internal `d₀`).
4. (crux 1, separate girder) **`goodstein_implies_prwo`** — Rathjen §3 internal Cor 3.4 (blocked, see below).

## ⭐⭐⭐ Lap 49 (2026-06-23) — generic-route Cor 3.4 lead bricks + crux-2 grounded
Confirmed **M1 (`goodsteinTerminates_re`) and Phase-1 reduction (`not_proves_of_implies_consistency`)
are already complete & axiom-clean** — the operator's named M1 target was done by a prior lap; the only
open obligation is the deep Phase-2 girder `Reduction.goodstein_implies_consistency` (crux 1+2 below).

**CRUX 2 grounded this lap (Rathjen 2014 Thm 2.8, read pp. 8–11) → `CRUX2-GENTZEN-2026-06-23.md`.** The
Phase-2 Gentzen girder `PRWO(ε₀)→Con(PA)` decomposed lemma-by-lemma over Foundation's ARITHMETIZED
`Theory.Derivation : V → Prop` (located): `prwoSentence` (the hinge — formulate PRWO, highest confab risk),
primrec `ord`/`R` on coded derivations, `ord(R D) ≺ ord D` (Gentzen reduction, the deep core), assemble
via primrec descent `n ↦ ord(R^[n] d)` vs PRWO. Independent of crux 1; NOT blocked on Ackermann. Next-lap
candidate if crux-1's Ackermann-`F` infra stays blocked. Keep crux-2 scaffold sorries in `wip/`.

**Done this lap (`InternalCor34.lean`, axiom-clean, green 1311):** the generic Cor 3.4 lead at a
*non-standard* level `l : V` (the meta-`ibigMul (k:ℕ)` was only the standard-level special case).
- `oadd1iter_eq_succ` / `iAbove_ibigMul_finCode` — cast the `MinExpGe` threshold iterate to finite-code
  form (standard level).
- **`iVbigMul β l = (ω·)^l β`** — V-indexed `ω^l·β` as a genuine `𝚺₁` primitive recursion (`PR.Construction`,
  mirror of `iAboveTable`), with `isNF_iVbigMul`/`icmp_iVbigMul`/`iC_iVbigMul_le` by `sigma1_succ_induction`.
- **`iAbove_finCode_iVbigMul`** — V-indexed MinExpGe: `ω^(l+2)·β` clean above finite code `l+1`.
  (Motive-definability needed an EXPLICIT `Definable.comp₂` term — aesop blows up on the `iAbove` rule;
  see memory `definability-aesop-depth-blowup`.) Plus `iVbigMul_ne_zero`, `isNF_finCode`, `iadd_one_finCode`,
  `iAbove_zero_iVbigMul`.

**DONE — steps 1 & 2 of the prior plan (this lap, all green/axiom-clean):**
1. ✅ **Generic clean-append on `iVbigMul`** — `iAbove_code_iVbigMul`, `iAbove_ocExp_iVbigMul_fin/_inf`
   discharge `iAbove (ocExp g) (iVbigMul β (l+1))` for finite or infinite-top-exponent `g < ω^(l+1)`.
2. ✅ **`icorAlpha` assembly** — `icorAlpha β g l := iadd (iVbigMul β (l+1)) g` with the three portable
   Cor-3.4 properties: `icorAlpha_within` (`icmp_iadd_clean_within`), `icorAlpha_boundary`
   (`icmp_iadd_clean_boundary`+`icmp_iVbigMul`), `icorAlpha_C_le` (`iC_iadd_clean`+`iC_iVbigMul_le`).
   Validated end-to-end at level 0 with concrete `ig0` (`icorAlpha_ig0_within`). NB: `iVbigMul` is now
   `irreducible` (its `construction.result` never reduces on a variable level → whnf blow-up); the full
   4-hyp `icmp_iadd_clean` also blows up on unification — use the `_within`/`_boundary` wrappers.

**NEXT — two genuinely deep, isolated remaining pieces (crux 1 step 3):**
3a. **The internal `ig` f-recursion over level `l:V`** — `ig (l+1) n m = iblk (l+1) (…) (ig l (f^[blk] n)
   (off))` bottoms out at the internal Grzegorczyk `F` (Ackermann-level, NOT IΣ₁-total ⟹ needs the FULL-PA
   reduct `reduct_models_PA`, a different layer than this `V ⊧ 𝗜𝚺₁` file). Abstract-`ig` interface (provide
   `isNF`, `ocExp(ig) = code j ∨ 0` with `j ≤ l`, `ig ≠ 0`, `iC(ig) ≤ K(n+m+1)`, within/boundary descent as
   hyps — exactly what `icorAlpha_*` consume) defers the F-construction; discharge `f` separately.
3b. **The X-definable block bookkeeping** (`corBlk`/`corOff` over the raw descent's C-widths `corW β t =
   iC(β(t+1))`) — assembles the global slow sequence `α : V → V`. **KEY FINDING this lap: this is NOT cleanly
   IΣ₁** — `W = corW β` is X-definable (β lives in the LX descent layer, `DescentConstruction`), so `iwsum`/
   `iwidx`/`iwoff` must be built X-definably THERE (mirror `Grz.wsum`/`widx`/`woff`, lines 159-217), not in
   this generic-`V` file. The resulting α feeds `InternalThm35.bbeta` (Thm 3.5, DONE) → `nonterminating_of_xDescent`.

## ⭐⭐⭐ Lap 47 (2026-06-23) — internal Thm 3.5 COMPLETE; the two §3/Gentzen cruxes are next
Discharged lap-46 item 4's remaining input: **ω-tower cofinality** `iwtower_cofinal : ∀ c, ∃ s, icmp c
(iwtower s) = 0` (`InternalThm35`, axiom-clean), proved with NO NF hypothesis (`icmp_ocOadd_lt_exp` reads
only the leading exponent, so `sigma1_order_induction` at `ocExp c < c` decides the whole code; witness
`s` = the iterated-exponent depth). ⟹ `bbeta_desc_exists` gives the full Thm 3.5 descending sequence
**unconditionally** (no `hbdry`). **Internal Thm 3.5 is now hypothesis-free and route-independent.**

**The two open deep cruxes (hardest-first), both multi-lap — the live work:**
1. **Internal Cor 3.4** (THE harder). Produce the slow internal descent `α : V → V` (`iC(αₙ)≤K(n+1)`,
   `isNF`, `icmp`-descent) from a raw primrec ε₀-descent. Internal level `l:V` ⟹ Ackermann ⟹ needs the PA
   substrate. **Recommended first attack (lap-45 path #2): parameterize over an abstract internal `f`**
   (recursion eqns + Lemma-3.2 domination as hypotheses); build `ig`/`icorAlpha`/descent+bound relative to
   it; discharge `f`'s existence separately. Blueprint = `Grzegorczyk.lean` ℕ-template. The standard-`l`
   `InternalCor34` (`ig0`/`iblk`/`ibigMul`) is reusable bricks (special case), NOT the generic route.
2. **Gentzen Thm 2.8(i) `PRWO(ε₀)→Con(𝗣𝗔)`** + formulate **`PRWO(ε₀)` as a `Sentence ℒₒᵣ`**. Primrec `ord`
   + reduction `R`, `ord(R D)<ord D`, over Foundation `Derivation`. THE deep ordinal-analysis girder.

**Decision for next lap:** start crux 1 via the abstract-`f` parameterization (path #2) — it lets the
genuine `g`-padding math land green now without first building internal Ackermann. See `Reduction.lean`
docstring + STATUS "Where it stands" for the full chain.

**Crux-1 PROGRESS (lap 47, `InternalCor34.lean`, axiom-clean):** Cor 3.4's slowed term
`αⱼ = ω^(l+1)·βₙ + g(l,n,m)` needs a GENERAL clean append (`g` is a genuine ordinal `< ω^(l+1)`, not the
finite tail the `betaTail` lemmas handle). Built the internal analog of `Grz.AllExpAbove`/`C_add_clean`:
- `iadd_clean_step` — the `gt`-branch recursion of `iadd` under the clean head condition.
- `iAbove e0 a` (Σ₁-flag predicate via a parameterized course-of-values table, + `iAbove_zero`/`iAbove_ocOadd`
  recursion) — "every leading exponent down `a`'s spine `≻ e0`" (internal `MinExpGe`).
- **`icmp_iadd_clean_within`** — two clean appends onto the SAME head compare by their tails:
  `icmp (iadd a b₁)(iadd a b₂) = icmp b₁ b₂` (= internal `corAlpha_within`, the `g`-descent through the
  fixed lead). Plus `ocExp_iadd_clean` (head exponent preserved).
**Crux-1 NEXT (hardest-first):**
1. **`icmp_iadd_clean_boundary`** — `icmp a₁ a₂ = 0 → icmp (iadd a₁ b₁)(iadd a₂ b₂) = 0` (head drops; =
   internal `corAlpha_boundary`). Needs the shared-prefix recursion; cleanest with `isNF a₁/a₂` + the
   `icmp = 1 ⟹ equal-code` fact (so equal exponents are literal, enabling `icmp_ocOadd_same_head`). For
   Cor 3.4 use `icmp_ibigMul` gives `icmp a₁ a₂ = icmp β' β`. A unified `icmp (iadd a₁ b₁)(iadd a₂ b₂) =
   thenV (icmp a₁ a₂)(icmp b₁ b₂)` would subsume within+boundary.
2. **`iC_iadd_clean`** — `iC (iadd a b) ≤ max (iC a)(iC b)` under `iAbove (ocExp b) a` (= internal
   `C_add_clean`, the slowness C-split). Also `iAbove`-preservation lemmas for `ibigMul`/`iomul` (the head
   `ω^(l+1)·βₙ` satisfies `iAbove (ocExp g) ·` since `g < ω^(l+1)`) = internal `MinExpGe_bigMul`/`AllExpAbove_bigMul`.
3. Then the abstract-`ig` interface (recursion eqns + descent + `iC ≤ K(n+m+1)` + `ig < ω^(l+1)` as hyps),
   `icorAlpha`, and the internal `ig` recursion on level `l:V` (the f-recursion; the genuinely deep last step).

## ⭐⭐⭐ Lap 46 (2026-06-23) — ROUTE RESOLVED: PRWO(ε₀)→Con(PA)+Gödel II (Rathjen Thm 2.8)
Operator-directed Route A. Lap-45's fork is **settled** (memory `route-resolved-prwo-gentzen`):
- **Headline path** = Rathjen Cor 3.7: `𝗣𝗔⊢γ →(§3, primrec) 𝗣𝗔⊢PRWO(ε₀) →(Gentzen Thm 2.8(i)) 𝗣𝗔⊢Con(PA)`,
  then Gödel II. This IS `Reduction.goodstein_implies_consistency` (now decomposed in its docstring).
- **The free-X β-wall (`DescentSemantic:582`) is the WRONG target**: §3 is primrec-only; an oracle X
  descent isn't dominated (machine-checked `not_dominated_of_diag_le`). But a **PRWO** descent is
  *internally* primrec ⟹ Lemma 3.2 applies internally ⟹ unblocked. `peano_not_proves_TI` (free-X)
  does NOT chain (free-X-TI ⊢ PRWO, wrong direction) — banked asset, off-path.
- **DONE this lap (axiom-clean):** `InternalThm35.bbtail_isNF/_C_le/_desc` — the model-internal Thm 3.5
  block-tail (`r ≥ K`): from a slow internal descent α produce βᵣ = ω·α_{(r-K)/K}+(K-(r-K)%K) with
  strict ≺-descent and the TIGHT `iC(βᵣ) ≤ r+1`, via internal division. Route-independent.
- **Open cruxes (hardest-first), both deep / multi-lap:**
  1. **Internal Cor 3.4** — Grzegorczyk hierarchy `f:V→V→V` over `V ⊧ 𝗣𝗔` (internal level `l:V`,
     Ackermann, not IΣ₁-total ⟹ needs the PA substrate `reduct_models_PA`). Produces the slow α that
     `bbtail_*` consumes. lap-45 path #2 (parameterize over abstract f) recommended first.
  2. **Gentzen Thm 2.8(i) `PRWO(ε₀)→Con(PA)`** — primrec `ord` + reduction `R`, `ord(R D)<ord D`,
     arithmetized in PA over Foundation's `Derivation`. The deep ordinal-analysis girder.
  3. **Formulate `PRWO(ε₀)` as a `Sentence ℒₒᵣ`** (∀ primrec-code descent → finite); gates both 1,2.
  4. Thm 3.5 **prefix + full β — DONE (modulo one cofinality input)**. `bbeta K s α` (`InternalThm35`)
     is the complete Thm 3.5 sequence indexed from `0`: ω-tower prefix for `r<K` (SIMPLIFIED to single
     towers `βⱼ = ω_{s+K−1−j}` — valid since `C` is the max coeff, not term count, so `C=1≤j+1`),
     block-tail `bbtail` for `r≥K`. Axiom-clean: `bbeta_isNF`, `bbeta_C_le : iC(βᵣ)≤r+1` (all r),
     `bbeta_desc` (prefix→prefix / seam / block→block). **Remaining = ONE disclosed hypothesis**
     `hbdry : icmp (bbtail K α K) (iwtower s) = 0` (i.e. `β_K ≺ ωₛ`): ω-tower **cofinality** in ε₀
     — `∀ NF code c, ∃ s, c ≺ iwtower s`, with a concrete `s = σ(α₀,K)`. Next lap: prove cofinality.
     Supporting: `iwtower` (ω-tower on codes), `icmp_iwtower_succ`, `icmp_ocOadd_lt_exp`.
- Foundation `PA_delta1Definable` axiom rides Gödel II (separate residual; lap-6 noted upstream burndown).


## ⭐⭐ Lap 45 (2026-06-23) — VALIDATED PIVOT: §3-on-X is BLOCKED; route is now Trevor's call
**Read `E-ARCHITECTURE-REVIEW-2026-06-23.md` §H + `HANDOFF.md`.** Independently re-derived in-box AND
confirmed against the external review. The lap-27→44 plan (run Rathjen §3 slow-down on the X-definable
descent → free-X `TI_≺(X)`) is **structurally blocked, not merely hard**:
- `peano_not_proves_TI` is genuinely **free-X** (checklist #1: `Xsym` free, `prec` concrete) — the
  *strong* back-end; a §3 reduction to primrec-PRWO cannot reach it.
- The §3 domination `∃ l, ∀ n, C(β(n+1)) ≤ F_l n` is **FALSE for an X-definable descent** — now
  MACHINE-CHECKED (`Grz.not_dominated_of_diag_le`/`F_diag_not_dominated`, commit `279050d`): the
  Grzegorczyk hierarchy's diagonal escapes every fixed level, so domination is primrec-only.
- Root cause of the misalignment: a non-standard / X-definable descent needs an **internal** (V-level,
  Ackermann) Grzegorczyk level — NOT a fixed meta-l — and `f_l` for `l:V` is NOT IΣ₁-provably total.
  So the lap-40→44 meta-iterate `ibigMul` / meta-recursion `ig` design cannot produce the needed β.

**THE FORK (Trevor decides — do NOT pick unilaterally; lap-12 forbade Route A's axiom on the headline):**
1. **Route A** (Rathjen's actual proof): primrec §3 → primrec-PRWO → Con(PA) → Gödel II.
   `Grzegorczyk.lean` already fits (primrec). Cost: disclosed `PA_delta1Definable` (still an `axiom` in
   the pin) + the unbuilt `TI(ε₀)⊢Con(PA)` girder (`Reduction.lean:52`; PA∞ cut-elim — distinct from
   Buchholz §5). Attack paths: (a) check if a Foundation pin-bump discharges `PA_delta1Definable`
   upstream (lap-6 noted a session was on it); (b) build the Gentzen ordinal-analysis girder.
2. **Route B via Kirby–Paris 1982** (model-theoretic indicators): keep free-X; replace §3-on-X with
   the KP indicator argument inside `M ⊧ paLX` (the wall `no_min_descent_absurd_of_goodstein` is already
   model-internal — natural continuation). Avoids the axiom. Read `papers/kirby-paris-1982-…pdf`.
   Attack paths: (a) formalize indicators / the Σ₁-definable "gap" function; (b) the
   Paris–Harrington-style density argument adapted to Goodstein.
3. **§3-on-X: DEAD** — `InternalCor34` meta-l grind must NOT resume.

**Survives regardless:** `peano_not_proves_TI` (axiom-clean), `Grzegorczyk.lean` (primrec §3, Lemma 3.3
complete + the obstruction lemma), `InternalONote` code arithmetic, `InternalCor34.ig0` + general
`ocOadd` descent lemmas (substrate-agnostic leaves).

### SHARPENED (lap 45, end) — the crux is localized to Cor 3.4; Thm 3.5 + Lemma 3.6 are done/tractable
Grounded the Route-A back-end against Rathjen pp.13–14 (Lemma 3.6, Cor 3.7, Thm 2.8). Precise map:
- **Lemma 3.6** (the special-Goodstein run never terminates, given `C(βₙ) ≤ n+1`) = repo's **DONE**
  `DescentArith.nonterminating_internal` / `DescentSlowdown.slowdown_run_facts` (axiom-clean).
- **Thm 3.5** (slow `α` → `β`, `C(βᵣ) ≤ r+1`) is **level-agnostic, no Ackermann, IΣ₁-tractable**: finite
  tails + `r = K(n+1)+i` *division* indexing. Internal C-bound `iC_betaTail_le` LANDED (lap 45); descent
  = `icmp_betaTail_within/_boundary`, NF = `isNF_iadd_finite` (built). Remaining: the `β:V→V` assembly
  (internal division reindex + the `j<K` ω-tower prefix) — mechanical, route-agnostic.
- **Cor 3.4** (raw descent → slow `α`, the Grzegorczyk `g`-padding) = **THE deep crux, common to both
  routes.** Needs the Grzegorczyk level `l`; for ANY *quantified/generic* descent (Route A's ∀-primrec
  PRWO, or Route B's oracle X-descent) `l` is **internal (`l:V`)** ⟹ `f_l` is Ackermann ⟹ **NOT
  IΣ₁-provably-total** ⟹ needs a **PA substrate** (`V ⊧ₘ* 𝗣𝗔`), not the IΣ₁ `PR.Construction` toolkit.
  CORRECTION to the lap-45 mid-note: the meta-`l` `InternalCor34` design (`ig0`, `iblk`, `ibigMul`) is
  NOT outright dead — it is the **standard-`l`** special case (correct when the descent's level is a
  fixed standard natural), and `ig0` + the general `ocOadd` lemmas are reused by the internal-`l` version.
  But the *generic* slow-down needs internal `l`.

**3 attack paths for the Cor 3.4 crux (internal-`l` `g`-padding):**
1. **Build internal Ackermann/Grzegorczyk `f : V→V→V` over `V ⊧ 𝗣𝗔`** (Σ₁-graph + PA-totality by
   induction on the level), then `ig`/`icorAlpha` by PA-induction on `l:V`. Most direct, heaviest.
2. **Parameterize over an abstract internal `f`** (take `f`'s recursion eqns + Lemma-3.2 domination as
   hypotheses / a structure supplied by `M ⊧ 𝗣𝗔`), build `ig`/`icorAlpha`/descent+bound relative to it,
   and discharge `f`'s existence separately (disclosed). Lets the genuine `g`-math land green now; most
   tractable. ⟸ RECOMMENDED first.
3. **Restructure `g` to avoid `f_l`**: define blocks by the descent's *actual* widths (incremental V
   recursion) and prove the linear `C`-bound directly. Risk: the linear bound may genuinely need the
   Grzegorczyk recursion (Rathjen's `g` is built that way precisely for the linear bound) — may be false.

**Route decision still open** (Trevor): (A) Rathjen Con(PA)+Gödel II [carries `PA_delta1Definable`; reuses
Cor 3.4 + Buchholz §5 for Thm 2.8] vs (B′) Kirby–Paris model-theoretic indicators [axiom-clean back-end;
fresh technique]. Cor 3.4 (internal-`l`) is needed by (A); (B′) replaces §3 entirely with indicators.


## ⭐ Reflection — 2026-06-23 (lap 44, DEEP) — the wall `sorry` is framed on a DEAD path; rewire it FIRST

Full synthesis in `REFLECTION-2026-06-23-lap44.md`. Two findings:

- **(A) `DescentSemantic.no_min_descent_absurd_of_goodstein` (`:574`) routes through the DEAD 𝚺₁ path.**
  The literal `sorry` lives inside `hCD`, which uses `hbound` (`∃ m₀ b, 𝚺₁-Function₁ b ∧ …`) +
  `DescentArith.nonterminating_internal`. But the bound `b` is built from the **X-definable** descent, so
  it is genuinely **X-dependent** ⟹ no 𝚺₁ `b` exists in a general model ⟹ the `hbound` 𝚺₁ shape is
  **UNACHIEVABLE / FALSE**, not just hard. **Action (next lap, do first):** rewire `hCD` to the in-file
  **`nonterminating_of_xDescent`** (lap 41, X-essential `lx_succ_induction`). It needs `β : M → M` with
  `∀k isNF (β k)`, `∀k iCanon (k+1) (β k)`, `∀k icmp (β(k+1)) (β k)=0`, and the LX-definable run comparison
  `hPdef`. The residual `sorry` then becomes the HONEST "produce `β`" obligation. The 𝚺₁ engine
  (`nonterminating_internal`/`hbound_of_slowdown`/`nonterminating_of_slowdown` in `DescentSlowdown`) is
  sorry-free + axiom-clean — KEEP as a banked asset (charter: never delete completed proofs), just stop
  routing the live wall through it.

- **(B) `Grzegorczyk.lean` collapses Rathjen's length `|·|` (Lemma 3.3(2)/Cor 3.4) onto C.** Self-consistent
  on paper (`C ≤ |·|`; the absolute `C(βᵣ)≤r+1` is Thm 3.5, built in `DescentCore.C_betaTail_le` via
  `C_omega_mul_le`) but UNVERIFIED until the ℕ Cor 3.4 assembly (item 1 below) typechecks. If the C-bound
  won't close, define `len : ONote → ℕ` (the symbol-count `|·|`), prove `C ≤ len`, redo Lemma 3.3(2) on
  `len`, and bound `C` via `C ≤ len` at the end.

**Status of the run/consumer side (all DONE):** `nonterminating_of_xDescent`, `slowdown_run_facts`,
`ineq6_step_internal`, `DescentCore` Thm 3.5 reindex + `lemma36_nonterminating`, the unconditional descent
`descentR`/`descent_iterate_seq_total`. The ONLY remaining content = produce the M-internal `β`.

## ⭐ Lap 43 — **Rathjen Lemma 3.3 COMPLETE in the ℕ-template** (`Grzegorczyk.lean`, 6 axiom-clean commits, green 1309)

The genuine combinatorial heart of the slow-down wall (Lemma 3.3, the Grzegorczyk `g`) is now fully
machine-checked in the self-contained ℕ-template `src/GoodsteinPA/Grzegorczyk.lean`:
- `F` (the hierarchy `F 0 n=n+1`, `F (l+1) n=(F l)^[n] n`); `g0` base case.
- `blk k c x = ω^k·c+x` + Rathjen's two ordinal descent cases (`repr_blk_within`, `repr_blk_boundary`).
- Block decomposition `blockIdx`/`blockOff` (via `Nat.findGreatest`) + full correctness specs
  (`psum_blockIdx_le`, `blockIdx_lt`, `lt_psum_blockIdx_succ`, `blockOff_lt_width`, `blockIdx_eq`).
- **`g`** recursion (`g (l+1) n m = blk (l+1) (n-i) (g l (F_l^i n) j)` for `m<F(l+1)n`, else 0).
- Invariants `g_lt` (`repr (g l n m) < ω^(l+1)`), `g_NF`.
- **`g_desc`** (Lemma 3.3(1) DESCENT — the hard property; within/boundary/exhausted case split).
- **`g_C_bound`** (Lemma 3.3(2) BOUND `C(g l n m) ≤ K_l·(n+m+1)`).

**REMAINING toward `hbound` (hardest-first):**
1. **(ℕ-template Cor 3.4 assembly)** — from a descending `β:ℕ→ONote` + a **domination** `∃ l, ∀ n, |β_{n+1}| ≤ F l n`,
   build `αⱼ = ω^ω·βₙ + g l n m` (`j = Σ_{t≤n}|βₜ| + m`, `m<|β_{n+1}|`): descent (within-block via `g_desc`,
   across-block via `βₙ ≻ β_{n+1}` + `ω^ω` absorbing `g<ω^ω`), slowness `C(αⱼ)≤K(j+1)` (via `g_C_bound`).
   Needs a `|·|`-length/`C` measure on `ONote` for the block widths + block-finding on the β side
   (mirror of `blockIdx`). NOTE: the domination hypothesis is where "β primitive recursive" bites
   (Lemma 3.2 = `exists_lt_ack_of_nat_primrec`, + `ack ≤ F l` relation); state Cor 3.4 abstractly over
   the domination so the M-internal version supplies its own.
2. **(Thm 3.5 reindex)** — feed the slow α into the EXISTING `DescentCore` template
   (`C_betaTail_le`, `repr_betaTail_within/_boundary`) ⟹ β' with `C(β'ᵣ)≤r+1` ⟹ `lemma36_nonterminating`.
3. **(M-internalization)** — port the whole ℕ-template chain onto `InternalONote` M-codes; the M-internal
   subtlety is whether the domination holds for the X-dependent descent's block-length function.

## ⭐ Lap 42 (REVIEW) — `IterPrefix_lxDef` DISCHARGED; the descent EXISTS unconditionally; **the real crux is now the Rathjen §3 SLOW-DOWN**

**Done lap 42 (1 commit, axiom-clean, green 1308):** `IterPrefix_lxDef` + `minClause_lxDef`
(`DescentConstruction.lean`) — the lap-41 "lone wall" (`hPdef`). The membership-form trick
(`isDescent_iff_mem`: X-atom on a *bound* variable) that `DescentConstruction.descent_seq_exists`
already used for the `Mlt`-descent applies verbatim to the **`descentR`** route. So `IterPrefix`'s four
clauses (`skel`/`descentMlt`/`minClause`/`xclause`) are each binary-`LX`-definable; the only new one is
`minClause` (the `descentR` minimality `∀ z<x', ¬(Mlt f z x ∧ ¬MX z)` via Foundation `ballLT`). Result:
**`descent_iterate_seq_total : ∀ k:M, IterPrefix hM f a₀ k` is UNCONDITIONAL** — the canonical
`Mlt`-descent prefix exists at every length, no hypotheses. (Lap 41 over-rated this as "genuine
multi-lap infra"; it was one membership-form clause.)

**⚠️ FRESH-MIND COURSE-CORRECTION — the prior `hbound` decomposition under-specified the SLOWNESS.**
The lap-41 plan (piece 1) claimed the extracted descent `α` comes "with `iC(α k) ≤ K(k+1)` (Rathjen
`|αₖ|≤K(k+1)`)". **That is NOT automatic.** `descentR` picks the `<`-least `¬MX` code `≺ αₖ`; its
coefficient `C` is uncontrolled. Rathjen gets the bound only via **Corollary 3.4** (read `papers/
rathjen-2014…pdf` p.11–12): pad an arbitrary descent into a *slow* one (`|αᵢ|≤K(i+1)`) using the
Grzegorczyk function `g` from **Lemma 3.3** (`g(n,m)>g(n,m+1)` for `m<f(n)`, `|g(n,m)|≤K(n+m+1)`).
**Only then** does **Theorem 3.5**'s reindex `β_{K(n+1)+i}=ω·αₙ+(K-i)` give `C(βᵣ)≤r+1`. The lap-41
`InternalONote` toolkit (`iC_iomul`/`iC_iadd_finite`/`icmp_betaTail_*`) is the **Thm-3.5** code
arithmetic; **Cor 3.4 (the `g`/Grzegorczyk padding) is NOT started and is the genuine remaining wall.**

**Also flag (stale code):** `no_min_descent_absurd_of_goodstein`'s `hbound` `sorry`
(`DescentSemantic.lean:569`) still demands a `𝚺₁-Function₁ b`. That is UNACHIEVABLE — `b` is
`X`-dependent (derived from `no_min`/`MX`). The correct route is lap-41's `nonterminating_of_xDescent`
(the `lx_nonterminating`/`X`-essential path). When β is built, **refactor `hCD` to go through
`nonterminating_of_xDescent`**, deleting the dead `𝚺₁` `hbound`+`DescentArith.nonterminating_internal`.

**REMAINING for `hbound`, hardest-first (revised lap 42):**
1. **(HARD CRUX — Rathjen Cor 3.4 slow-down)** — internalize the `g`/Lemma 3.3 Grzegorczyk padding on
   `M`-codes: from an `icmp`-descent of ε₀-codes, produce a SLOW `icmp`-descent with `iC(αᵢ)≤K(i+1)`.
   Lemma 3.2 = mathlib `exists_lt_ack_of_nat_primrec` (ack ≈ Grzegorczyk fₙ). **This is multi-lap.**
   Decompose: (a) ℕ-template `g : ℕ²→ONote` + descent/bound lemmas (Aristotle-eligible, self-contained);
   (b) internalize as `M`-code recursion.
2. ✅ **(DONE lap 42) Extract `α : M → M`** — `descent_alpha_exists` (`DescentConstruction.lean`):
   `α 0=a₀`, `∀k ¬MX(α k)`, `∀k descentR f (α k)(α(k+1))`. Coherence via `IterPrefix_agree` (prefix
   agreement by X-free `sigma1_succ_induction` + `descentR_functional`). Axiom-clean. ⟹ `Mlt`-descent +
   each `¬MX` (`descentR_descends`). NOTE: `α` is NOT yet known slow — that's piece 1 (Cor 3.4).
3. **(plumbing) Decode `Mlt`→`icmp`** on codes (the route-b seam): `Mlt f y x` (`=prec`, X-free) ⟺
   `icmp y x = 0` on the ε₀-code reading; `isNF (α k)`. Needs the `prec`↔`icmp` bridge in `M`.
4. **(ARITH, toolkit ready) Thm 3.5 reindex** `α(slow) → β`, `βᵣ=ω·αₙ+(K-i)` — `iCanon(r+1)`
   (`iC_iomul`+`iC_iadd_finite`), `icmp`-descent (within+boundary), `isNF` (`isNF_iadd_finite`).
5. **`hPdef'` + close** — LX-def of `ievalNat(k+1)(βₖ)≤igoodstein m₀ k` (`lxDef_of_reduct` on the 𝚺₁
   `ievalNat`/`igoodstein` graphs + β's LX-formula); `nonterminating_of_xDescent` ⟹ `hCD` ⟹ `hbound`.
   ANTI-FRAUD: re-`#print axioms` headline (must stay `sorryAx` until the WHOLE chain is real) + girder.

## ⭐ Lap 41 — slow-down toolkit + run engine COMPLETE; `hbound` reduced to "build the X-definable β"

The lone wall is still `hbound` (`DescentSemantic.lean`, now ~line 460). Lap 41 closed the ENTIRE
code-level + run-level half (8 axiom-clean commits, green 1308):
- ✅ `icmp_iomul`, `icmp_betaTail_boundary`, `isNF_iomul`, `isNF_iadd_finite` (`InternalONote.lean`) —
  the slow-down's order/NF lemmas. Toolkit now complete: `iadd`/`iomul`, `iC_iomul`/`iC_iadd_finite`
  (⟹ `C(βₖ)≤k+1`), within+boundary descent, NF preservation, `ineq6_step_internal` (the (6) step).
- ✅ `DescentSlowdown.lean` (NEW): `slowdown_run_facts` (X-agnostic base/step/hpos core),
  `hbound_of_slowdown` (𝚺₁ path), `nonterminating_of_slowdown`.
- ✅ `DescentSemantic.nonterminating_of_xDescent` — **the reduction**: given `β:M→M` with the 3 arith
  facts (NF/iCanon(k+1)/icmp-descent) AND `hPdef` (LX-definability of `T̂^{k+2}(βₖ)≤mₖ`), the run from
  `T̂²(β₀)` never terminates. Via `slowdown_run_facts` + `lx_nonterminating` (X-essential). ⚠ The
  descent is X-DEPENDENT so the run MUST go through `lx_nonterminating`, NOT the 𝚺₁ path.
- ✅ `DescentSemantic.descentR` — the LX-definable functional descent-step relation to iterate:
  `descentR_exists` (=descent_step), `descentR_descends`, `descentR_lxDef`.

**REMAINING for `hbound` — three pieces, hardest-first:**
1. **(HARD CORE) M-internal X-definable iteration `α : M → M`** — `α 0 = a₀`, `α (k+1) = descentR-image`,
   for `k : M`. Build via an **LX recursion theorem**: `lx_succ_induction` over the LX-formula
   `Pk := ∃ s, Seq s ∧ lh s = k+1 ∧ znth s 0 = a₀ ∧ ∀ i<k, descentR (znth s i)(znth s (i+1)) ∧ ∀ i≤k ¬MX(znth s i)`
   (Seq/znth/lh are reduct-𝚺₁ → bridge via `lxDef_of_reduct`; `descentR` clause via `descentR_lxDef`).
   Then `α k := znth (the s) k` extracted via uniqueness. PREREQ: `descentR_functional` (uniqueness —
   needs reduct `<`-trichotomy; M⊧PA⁻ via `ReductModel.reduct_models_PA`, port `lt_trichotomy`).
   Gives `α`: `Mlt`-descending, each `¬MX`, with `icmp (α(k+1))(α k)=0` (decode `Mlt`=`prec`→`icmp` on
   codes — the route-(b) seam) + `isNF (α k)` + a coeff bound `iC(α k) ≤ K(k+1)` (Rathjen `|αₖ|≤K(k+1)`).
2. **(ARITH) Rathjen reindexing `α → β`** — `βᵣ = ω·αₙ + (K−i)`, `r = K(n+1)+i`, `i<K` (block n via
   `r/K`, offset `r%K`). Gives `iCanon(r+1) βᵣ` (`iC_iomul`+`iC_iadd_finite`, ℕ-template
   `DescentCore.C_betaTail_le`), `icmp`-descent (within `icmp_betaTail_within` + boundary
   `icmp_betaTail_boundary`), `isNF` (`isNF_iadd_finite`). Pure code arithmetic, 𝚺₁-definable in r.
3. **`hPdef`** — `T̂^{k+2}(βₖ)≤mₖ` is LX-definable: `lxDef_of_reduct` on the 𝚺₁ `ievalNat`/`igoodstein`
   graphs + the LX-formula for `β` (from 1+2). Then `nonterminating_of_xDescent` ⟹ `hCD` ⟹ close `hbound`.
   ANTI-FRAUD: re-`#print axioms peano_not_proves_TI` (must stay clean) AND `peano_not_proves_goodstein`
   (must stay `sorryAx` until the WHOLE chain is real) after any edit near the girder/headline.

## ⭐ Lap 40 — internal ordinal arithmetic for the slow-down STARTED (2 axiom-clean commits)

Read Rathjen 2014 §3 ("Slowing down", Thm 2.6 proof + Def 3.1) on disk — confirmed the slow-down
(arbitrary ε₀-descent → sequence feeding the **special** Goodstein `igoodstein`) is irreducible and
fundamentally needs `ω·α` multiplication + CNF addition on codes. Built the two foundational internal
ops in `InternalONote.lean` (both `#print axioms`-clean, build green 1307):
- ✅ **`iadd`** (`47c267b`) — internal CNF ordinal addition `a+b` on codes, CofV table indexed by the
  first summand (param = b), 3-way leading-exponent `icmp` branch. Lemmas `iadd_zero_left`,
  `iadd_ocOadd`.
- ✅ **`iomul`** (`1af80bc`) — internal ω-multiplication `ω·c`, exponent bump `e↦1+e = iadd (ocOadd 0
  1 0) e`, recurse tail. Lemmas `iomul_zero`, `iomul_ocOadd`.

**KEY SIMPLIFICATION (lap 40):** `ineq6_step_internal` (the `step`) keeps `ievalNat βₖ` SYMBOLIC —
it only needs `isNF`, `iCanon`, `icmp`-descent of the codes, NOT computed `ievalNat` values. So the
messy `ievalNat_iadd`/`ievalNat_iomul` laws are NOT needed for the assembly. Only `isNF` + `iC`(canon)
+ `icmp`-descent of the `βₖ = ω·αₖ + (K-i)` codes are required.

**DONE this lap (7 commits, all axiom-clean, green 1307):**
- ✅ `iadd` (CNF addition), `iomul` (ω·α).
- ✅ `iC_one_add`, `iC_iomul` (`iC(ω·c) ≤ iC c + 1`), `iC_iadd_finite` (`iC(ω·c + m) ≤ max(iC(ω·c)) m`)
  → the full `C(βₖ) ≤ k+1` canonicity bound (Rathjen Thm 3.5).
- ✅ `icmp_self`, `icmp_betaTail_within` (within-block descent `ω·α+p ≺ ω·α+(p+1)`).
- ✅ `icmp_one_add` (`1+·` preserves the comparison) + helpers — the boundary crux.

**NEXT (hardest-first) toward `hbound`:**
1. **`icmp_iomul`** (`icmp (iomul a)(iomul b) = icmp a b`, ω-mult order-preserving) — structural
   induction via `icmp_one_add` (head) + IH (tail). NF hyps needed.
2. **boundary descent** `icmp (ω·αNext + s)(ω·α + t) = 0` from `icmp αNext α = 0` — via icmp_iomul
   (decision happens in the iomul part, before the appended finite tails).
3. **`isNF_iomul`, `isNF_iadd_finite`** — isNF preservation. Needed for step's isNF hyps.
4. **βₖ assembly** from the M-internal descent (seam) — 𝚺₁-def in k, `iCanon (k+1) βₖ` (iC bounds, HAVE),
   icmp-descent (within + boundary), isNF; `b k = ievalNat (k+1) βₖ`; `step` = `ineq6_step_internal`
   (HAVE); base/hpos; assemble `hbound`. Plus the SEAM rewire (route b) for the descent input.
Aristotle: idle. Candidate open lemma = `icmp_iomul` (self-contained given icmp_one_add). Spec before submit.

## ⭐ Lap 39 — internal arithmetic for `hbound`'s `step` COMPLETE (3 axiom-clean commits)

The lone wall is still `hbound` (`DescentSemantic.lean:416`). Pieces 1–2 of the decomposition are DONE
this lap (all `#print axioms`-clean, build green 1307):
- ✅ **`InternalONote.evalNat_succ_base`** `ievalNat (b+1) c = ibump (b+1) (ievalNat b c)` (isNF/iCanon),
  digit-direct strong induction (helpers `ilog_eq_of_bounds`, `ievalNat_tail_lt`, div/mod peel). `53d1b00`.
- ✅ **`InternalPow.ibump_mono`/`ibump_strictMono`** — ported the Aristotle ℕ blueprint (UUID 7c8bb0e8)
  into clean IΣ₁ (combined UB+strict-mono induction, no nlinarith). `c7675f0`.
- ✅ **`InternalONote.ineq6_step_internal`** — the internalized Rathjen ineq (6), = `hbound`'s `step`:
  `ievalNat (k+2) bk1 ≤ ibump (k+2) m - 1` from `bk1 ≺ bk` + `ievalNat (k+1) bk ≤ m`. Chains
  `evalNat_succ_base` + `ibump_mono` + `ievalNat_lt_of_icmp_eq_zero`. `5f9df55`.

**Remaining to assemble `hbound`** (`∃ m₀ b, 𝚺₁-Function₁ b ∧ b 0 ≤ igoodstein m₀ 0 ∧ step ∧ ∀k 0<b k`):
With `βₖ` the slowed descent, `b k = ievalNat (k+1) βₖ`, `m₀ = ievalNat 1 β₀`: `step` = `ineq6_step_internal`
(HAVE); `base` = refl; `hpos` = `ievalNat_pos` (need `βₖ ≠ 0`). The two HARD remaining pieces:
3. **Seam/F re-wire (route b)** — make `Mlt`/`precφ`/`MX` (in `paLX_models_TI_of_PA_provable`) decode to
   `icmp`/codes, so the `no_min` descent becomes a `≺`-descent of ε₀-codes. RISKY (touches the proven
   `peano_not_proves_TI` girder) — re-`#print axioms peano_not_proves_TI` after EVERY edit (must stay clean).
   FIRST investigate: `DescentLift`/`DescentSemantic` defs of `Mlt`/`MX`/`prec`; `Thm56.prec`/`precφ`;
   `SeamDefinability`. Decide whether a standalone "slow-down of an abstract code-descent" lemma can be
   built BEFORE the seam (so piece 4 proceeds in parallel).
4. **βₖ slow-down (Rathjen Thm 3.5)** + assemble — from the code-descent build `βₖ` with `iC βₖ ≤ k+1`
   (so `iCanon (k+1) βₖ`), still `≺`-descending; `𝚺₁`-definable in k; feed `DescentArith.nonterminating_internal`.

Aristotle: idle (next genuinely-open lemma = the slow-down or the seam; spec one before submitting).

## ⭐ Lap 38 — INTERNAL-ONOTE SUBSTRATE COMPLETE (read `HANDOFF-2026-06-23-lap38.md`)

`InternalONote.lean` now has the full ε₀-notation arithmetic inside `IΣ₁`, all axiom-clean: codes,
`iC`, `ievalNat`, `iCanon`, **`icmp`** (CNF comparison), **`isNF`** (well-formedness), and the **crux
`ievalNat_lt_of_icmp_eq_zero`** (order-reflection, Rathjen 2.3(iii), digit-direct). Remaining road to
`hbound` (`DescentSemantic.lean:392`), hardest-first:
1. internal `evalNat_succ_base` (`ievalNat (b+1) c = ibump (b+1) (ievalNat b c)`) — extract the tail
   bound `ievalNat_tail_lt` from order-reflection's `TB` first; needs `ilog` peel facts.
2. internal `ineq6_step` (port `DescentCore.ineq6_step` onto codes, uses 1 + order-reflection).
3. seam/F re-wire to transparent `natCodeT` (route (b); re-`#print axioms` girder after each change).
4. `βₖ` slow-down (Rathjen Thm 3.5) + assemble `hbound`.
Aristotle `ibump_mono` COMPLETE in `scratchpad/ibump_x/` (ℕ form), not yet ported to V.

## ⭐ Reflection — 2026-06-23 (lap 36, deep): NEW DIRECTION — refactor the sentence transparent. Read FIRST.

Full synthesis: `REFLECTION-2026-06-23-lap36.md`. Headline state (real `#print axioms`): girder
(`Thm56.peano_not_proves_TI`) **clean**; headline honest `sorry`; the chain `…_modulo_semantic` carries
exactly **one** `sorryAx` from `no_min_descent_absurd_of_goodstein`, which is `hCD` (wall C+D, `:410`) +
`hB` (wall B, `:419`).

**The finding — wall B is self-inflicted.** Every lap since 24 treated `goodsteinSentence = ∀⁰ codeOfREPred
goodsteinTerminates` (Foundation's opaque `Classical.epsilon` r.e. blob) as a FIXED target and tried to
*bridge to it* inside nonstandard `M` (wall B; the open `ON-LINE-REQUEST`; the "`PA_delta1Definable`-
flavoured gap"). But `goodsteinSentence` is **not** locked, and `Encoding.lean`'s docstring (lines 35–39)
**explicitly sanctions** refactoring it to a transparent form gated on the bridge spec.

**STOP**: bridging the opaque code; reasoning about `Classical.epsilon` Kleene codes on nonstandard inputs;
treating `goodsteinSentence` as immutable. The `ON-LINE-REQUEST.md` wall-B question is **superseded** — do
not wait on it.

**KEEP**: the lap-30 model-internal completeness architecture; the route-neutral ONote kernel
(`DescentCore`); route 1 (ordinal analysis — monument done; route 2 is no shortcut); `#print axioms` audits.

**✅ Transparent-sentence refactor — DONE lap 36 (wall B dissolved):**
1. ✅ `goodsteinSentence := “∀ m, ∃ N, !igoodsteinDef 0 m N”` (`Encoding.lean`, imports `InternalGoodstein`).
   `InternalPow.igoodstein` IS `InternalGoodstein.igoodstein` (one function, namespace `GoodsteinPA.InternalPow`).
2. ✅ `Bridge.goodsteinSentence_faithful` re-proved axiom-clean — identical locked RHS — eval via
   `InternalPow.igoodstein_defined.iff` + `InternalPow.igoodstein_nat` + `eq_comm`. `models_lMap_goodstein`
   compiled unchanged (form-independent, confirmed).
3. ✅ `hB` (`DescentSemantic.lean:419`) closed: `Semiformula.models_lMap.mp hgood` → `simp only
   [ReductModel.reduct_eq_standardModel]` → coerce `.toStruc ⊧` to `Evalbm (s := @standardModel M oM)`
   (defeq, `models_iff` rfl) → same eval `simp only` set → `hev m₀`. `ON-LINE-REQUEST` archived.
   Real `#print axioms`: `goodsteinSentence_faithful` clean; chain's lone `sorryAx` = `hCD` only.
   GOTCHA banked: to eval a `lMap Φ`-lifted ℒₒᵣ sentence in `M`'s reduct, `models_lMap.mp` gives
   `(inst.lMap Φ).toStruc ⊧ σ`; `simp only [reduct_eq_standardModel]` (NOT `rw` — dependent `reductORing`
   motive) rewrites the reduct to `standardModel oM`, then `have h : Evalbm (s := @standardModel M oM) … := this`
   coerces by defeq (`rw [models_iff]` does NOT fire on the `.toStruc ⊧` form).

**`hCD` NARROWED lap 36 — run side baked in; the lone open obligation is `hbound`.** `hCD`
(`DescentSemantic.lean:409`) now closes via `DescentArith.nonterminating_internal` + the run's
`𝚺₁`-definability (both proved), so the **only** remaining `sorry` is:
```
hbound : ∃ (m₀ : M) (b : M → M), (𝚺₁-Function₁ b) ∧
  b 0 ≤ igoodstein m₀ 0 ∧
  (∀ k, b k ≤ igoodstein m₀ k → b (k+1) ≤ igoodstein m₀ (k+1)) ∧   -- internalized ineq6_step
  (∀ k, 0 < b k)
```
This is the Rathjen §3 slow-down, internalized in `M`'s `𝗜𝚺₁`-reduct. Decomposition for the next laps
(the deep infra; DescentCore has all of it at ONote/ℕ level, the gap is making it `𝚺₁`-definable in `M`):
1. **Internal ordinal-notation codes + `C` (slow-down measure) in `M`.** Need CNF-coded ordinals as
   `M`-elements with `C(β) ≤ k` (`DescentCore.C`/`Canon_iff_C_le`) as a `𝚺₁` predicate on `M`.
2. **Internal `T̂_ω` evaluation** `ievalNat : M → M → M` (base, ordinal-code → value), `𝚺₁`-definable,
   matching `DescentCore.evalNat` on standard inputs (the InternalPow `ipow`/`ilog` substrate feeds this).
3. **Internal `βₖ` slow-down** from the descent `descent_seq_exists` (extract a coherent `a : M → M` or
   reuse the coded `W`; build `βₖ` with `C(βₖ) ≤ k+1` per `DescentCore.C_betaTail_le`), then
   `b k = ievalNat (k+2)^[k+2] (βₖ)`. `𝚺₁`-definable.
4. **Internalized `ineq6_step`** (`step`): the `Δ₀` numeral form of `DescentCore.ineq6_step` (Lemma 3.6,
   ineq (6)) — proved in `M` by its `𝗜𝚺₁` arithmetic. `base`/`hpos` fall out of the `βₖ` positivity.
This is multi-lap infrastructure (internalizing ONote arithmetic into a nonstandard `M`); attack hardest-
first = piece 2 (`ievalNat`) + piece 4 (`ineq6_step` internal), since pieces 1/3 are codings on top.

**LAP-37 progress (numeric bricks + Aristotle dispatch).** Landed `InternalLog.ilog_mono` (`2≤b`,
`0<n≤n'` ⟹ `ilog b n ≤ ilog b n'`, green). Identified that pieces 2/4 both bottom out on **`ibump`/
`evalNat` monotonicity** — the digit-direct "next hard chip" (lap-29 NB1), which is genuinely interdependent
(the per-digit bound and monotonicity are mutually recursive — `ibump b r < (b+1)^(ibump b e)` needs
`ibump b (ilog b r) < ibump b e`, i.e. mono, while mono's `e<e'` case needs that bound). Architected the
self-contained statement and **submitted `ibump_mono` to Aristotle** (UUID `7c8bb0e8-23cc-4118-9bab-70b37a2debbc`,
`scratchpad/ibump_mono.lean`): goal `2≤b → n≤n' → ibump b n ≤ ibump b n'` over ℕ with the true `ibump`/`ipow`/
`ilog` laws as axioms (algebra identical to the V-model, so a clean proof PORTS to `InternalBump`).
NEXT-LAP: poll `aristotle list`; on COMPLETE, verify + port to `src/GoodsteinPA/InternalBump.lean` as
`ibump_mono` (then strict-mono `ibump_strictMono` follows). This is the numeric core that internal `evalNat`
order-reflection (piece 2) and internal `ineq6_step` (piece 4) both consume.

**Also landed lap 37 (green): `DescentCore.evalNat_succ_base`** — `Canon b o → o.NF → 2≤b →
evalNat (b+1) o = bump (b+1) (evalNat b o)` (via `canon_round_trip` + `evalNat_toONote`). THE bridge:
raising the evalNat base by one is exactly the numeric `bump`. So `evalNat (k+2) βₖ = bump (k+2) (evalNat
(k+1) βₖ) = ibump (k+2) (b k)` — meaning the *internal* `ibump` substrate realizes `evalNat`'s base-bump
inside `M` directly (no separate internal ONote-evaluation needed for the base-change). This is the precise
restatement that `ineq6_step`'s `bump (k+2) m = evalNat (k+2) (toONote (k+2) m)` step should be rebuilt on
internally: internal `ineq6_step` = `ibump (k+2) (b k) - 1`-domination + internal evalNat ORDER-REFLECTION
(the still-open piece needing internal ONote codes for the `βₖ₊₁ ≺ βₖ` comparison).

**Refined decomposition of `hbound` after lap 37** (what internal ONote codes are STILL needed for):
- ✅ Base-change (evaluation) side: `evalNat (b+1) o = ibump (b+1) (evalNat b o)` — internalizes via the
  existing `ibump` substrate (`evalNat_succ_base` is the ℕ-shadow; internal version is `ibump`-direct).
- ❌ Order-reflection side: `βₖ₊₁ ≺ βₖ ⟹ evalNat (k+2) βₖ₊₁ < evalNat (k+2) βₖ` — STILL needs internal
  ONote codes + internal `evalNat` as a function of the code (`evalNat_lt_iff`/`evalNat_lt_of_lt`
  internalized). This is the irreducible internal-ONote requirement: the descent comparison.
- ❌ `βₖ` construction (the slow-down Thm 3.5 / Cor 3.4) from the M-internal descent (`descent_seq_exists`):
  needs internal ONote codes + internal `C` + the `C(βₖ) ≤ k+1` bound, all `LX`/`𝚺₁`-definable in `M`.
So the genuine remaining internal-ONote build is the CODE representation + `evalNat` (as code-fn) + `C` +
order-reflection. The base-change/run side is now substrate-direct. NEXT cold-start subproject:
`wip/InternalONote.lean` — code CNF terms as nested HFS pairs (`0 ↦ 0`, `oadd e n r ↦ ⟪⟪ec,n⟫,rc⟫`),
`isONoteCode` predicate (Fixpoint/Δ₁), `iC`/`ievalNat` via course-of-values table (à la `ibumpTable`),
internal `evalNat_lt_iff`. Multi-lap.

**⭐ STRATEGIC FINDING lap 37 (read `ANALYSIS-2026-06-23-lap37-order-reflection-opacity.md`).**
Grounded the order-reflection wall in Rathjen 2014 §3 (paper on disk). The descent is `Mlt f y x =
M ⊧ precφ(y,x)` with `precφ = codeOfREPred₂(natCode a < natCode b)` — the **opaque r.e. blob**, the
SAME opacity that was wall B; `natCode = (Denumerable.eqv NONote).symm` is arbitrary. Rathjen's βₖ
construction (Cor 3.4 / Thm 3.5) manipulates the **CNF** of descent elements, so the descent must be
decodable to CNF in `M`. **Route decision = (b): transparent HFS-CNF coding.** Build internal ONote
codes (a code IS its CNF), define `natCodeT : ℕ ≃ NONote` + transparent `precT`, re-wire seam + F
(`epsilon0_le_orderType_ltPull` holds for ANY `e : ℕ ≃ NONote`, so the order-type half transfers;
F-φ computability is easier for transparent CNF compare). Multi-lap girder refactor of the (axiom-
clean) order argument — re-validate `peano_not_proves_TI` with `#print axioms` at every step.

**✅ FOUNDATION STARTED lap 37 (green, sorry-free, `src/GoodsteinPA/InternalONote.lean`).** Internal
ONote CNF codes as nested HFS pairs: `ocOadd ec n rc := ⟪⟪ec,n⟫,rc⟫+1` (0 ↦ 0), decode projections
`ocExp`/`ocCoeff`/`ocTail` with round-trip simp lemmas, and the **subterm-bound lemmas** `ocExp_lt`/
`ocCoeff_lt`/`ocTail_lt` (+ `_of_pos` forms) — the course-of-values strict-decrease facts the next
recursions need.

**✅ `iC` (internal `C` max-coefficient) LANDED lap 37 (green, sorry-free, `InternalONote.lean`).**
Built `iC : V → V` via the same course-of-values table reduction as `ibump` (`iCTable n = ⟨iC 0,…,iC
n⟩`, `iCNext` reads the two sub-results at `ocExp`/`ocTail` out of the table). Proved `𝚺₁`-definable
(`iC_defined`), `iC_zero`, and the **recursion `iC_ocOadd : iC (ocOadd ec n rc) = max (max (iC ec) n)
(iC rc)`** (Rathjen's `C_oadd`). The CofV-table pattern now proven to work on the new codes.

**✅ `ievalNat` + `iCanon` LANDED lap 37 (green, sorry-free, `InternalONote.lean`).**
- `ievalNat : V → V → V` (Rathjen `T̂^b_ω` on codes) via the binary CofV table (parameter = base `b`),
  `𝚺₁`-definable, with `ievalNat_zero` + recursion `ievalNat_ocOadd : ievalNat b (ocOadd ec n rc) =
  n * ipow (b+1) (ievalNat b ec) + ievalNat b rc` (mirrors `Domination.evalNat_oadd`).
- `iCanon b c := iC c ≤ b` (internal `Canon`, FREE from `iC` via `Canon_iff_C_le`), with `iCanon_zero`,
  recursion `iCanon_ocOadd : iCanon b (ocOadd ec n rc) ↔ n ≤ b ∧ iCanon b ec ∧ iCanon b rc`, and the
  `Γ-Relation` definability instance.

**NEXT — the deep piece: internal order-reflection.** Two routes to the order the descent consumes:
1. `icmp : V → V → V` — 3-valued CNF lexicographic comparison via a BINARY CofV table indexed by the
   pair `⟪o,p⟫` (sub-calls `icmp(ocExp o, ocExp p)`/`icmp(ocTail o, ocTail p)` sit at `⟪e1,e2⟫`/
   `⟪r1,r2⟫` `< ⟪o,p⟫` by `pair_lt_pair`). Then `icmp` ≡ ievalNat-order on `iCanon` codes.
2. Direct internal `evalNat_lt_iff`: `iCanon b o → iCanon b p → isNF o → isNF p → (ievalNat b o <
   ievalNat b p ↔ o ≺ p)`. Structural induction using ievalNat arithmetic + the "tail value < leading
   power" NF bound (`ievalNat b rc < ipow (b+1) (ievalNat b ec)`). This is the SAME difficulty family
   as `ibump_mono` (on Aristotle, UUID `7c8bb0e8`) — harvest that proof's digit-direct technique first.
Also needed: internal `isNF` predicate (exponents strictly decreasing — needs `icmp`), and the internal
`evalNat_succ_base` (`ievalNat (b+1) c = ibump (b+1) (ievalNat b c)` for `iCanon b c ∧ isNF c`, by
structural induction + `ibump_pos`, given the NF leading-power bound). Then seam/F re-wire to `natCodeT`
(route b, `ANALYSIS-2026-06-23-lap37-order-reflection-opacity.md`) and the slow-down `βₖ`.

## 🎯 LAP-34 (2026-06-23) — wall-C/D model-internal induction TOOLKIT landed. Read FIRST.

**Done this lap (green 1304 jobs, all `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`, in `DescentSemantic.lean`):** the
`X`-essential induction toolkit `no_min_descent_absurd_of_goodstein`'s `hCD` (wall C+D) needs, all derived
from lap-33's `lx_succ_induction`:
- `lxDef_ballLT` — `fun x ↦ ∀ y<x, P y` is `LX`-definable when `P` is (installs `Structure.LT LX M` off
  `reductORing`; formula `(φ ⇜ ![#0]).ballLT #0`). The closure step order-induction needs.
- `lx_order_induction` — `<`-below progressivity ⟹ totality for `LX`-definable `P` over `M`'s reduct
  arithmetic `<`. Mirrors Foundation's `InductionOnHierarchy.order_induction`.
- `lx_least_number` — every nonempty `LX`-definable `P` has a `<`-least witness. **The choice-free,
  M-internal selector wall C's `Mlt`-descent recursion picks the canonical `Mlt`-smaller ¬MX element
  with** (resolves the ⚠ "must be definable, not metatheoretic `choice`" subtlety).
- `lx_nonterminating` — **wall-D run side, `X`-essential form.** Given an `LX`-definable bound predicate
  `P k := b k ≤ igoodstein m₀ k`, seed domination `b 0 ≤ m₀`, the internalized ineq-(6) `step`, and
  `0 < b k`, the run never reaches `0`. Iteration is `lx_succ_induction` (NOT the lap-29
  `igoodstein_nonterminating_of_dominating`, which wants an `ℒₒᵣ`-`𝚺₁` bound — but the Rathjen §3 bound
  `b k = T̂^{k+2}(βₖ)` is `X`-dependent, so that ℒₒᵣ tool is the wrong one; this is the corrected substrate).

**Wall-C SCAFFOLD landed in `wip/DescentConstruction.lean`** (typechecks, ONE disclosed `sorry`, off the
build so `src/` stays sorry-free): the `Seq`-coded `M`-internal descent.
- `IsDescent f a₀ W` — `W` codes a finite `Mlt`-descending sequence through `¬MX` from `a₀`.
- `descent_base` / `descent_extend` — **PROVEN** (real content): length-1 base + the canonical one-step
  `seqCons` extension via `descent_step` (incl. all the `znth`-preservation/`¬MX`/descent clauses; the
  generic-`M` order arithmetic uses Foundation `PeanoMinus` lemmas, NOT `omega`/`ring`).
- `descent_seq_exists` — `∀ k, ∃ W, IsDescent W ∧ lh W = k+1`, by `lx_succ_induction` (base/step wired).
  **The lone `sorry`** = `hDdef`, the `LX`-definability of `D(k) := ∃ W, IsDescent f a₀ W ∧ lh W = k+1`
  (a `Seq`-existential `LX`-formula with `Mlt`/`¬MX` atoms on `znth`-terms). NEXT-LAP TASK: build that
  formula. **LAP-35 progress — `isDescent_iff_mem` (PROVEN, wip):** reformulated `IsDescent` into
  **membership form** (over the reduct, when `0 < lh W`): `Seq W ∧ ⟪0,a₀⟫∈W ∧ (∀ i x x', ⟪i,x⟫∈W →
  ⟪i+1,x'⟫∈W → Mlt f x' x) ∧ (∀ i x, ⟪i,x⟫∈W → ¬MX x)`. **Key win:** the `X`-atom now sits on a *bound
  variable* `x`, not a `znth`-function-term — `hDdef` no longer needs `znth`-graph-into-`X` plumbing.
  **NEXT (hDdef, decomposed):** `D(k) ↔ ∃ W, A(W,k) ∧ B(W) ∧ C(W)` with
    - `A(W,k) := Seq W ∧ ⟪0,a₀⟫∈W ∧ lh W = k+1` — pure `ℒₒᵣ`-on-reduct (NO prec/X); `Semisentence` from
      Foundation `Defined.df` (`seq_defined`/`lh_defined`/membership+pairing DSL); bridge via a *binary*
      `lxDef2_of_reduct` (generalize `lxDef_of_reduct` to `![W,k]` + `a₀` as a free-var in `e`).
    - `B(W) := ∀ i x x', ⟪i,x⟫∈W → ⟪i+1,x'⟫∈W → Mlt f x' x` — `∈`-guards + `prec` atom (X-free, fvar-free)
      under bounded `∀∀∀`; build directly in `LX`.
    - `C(W) := ∀ i x, ⟪i,x⟫∈W → ¬MX x` — `∈`-guard + `Xsym`-atom under bounded `∀∀`; build directly.
    Combine via binary `lxDef2_and`, then `∃`-close `W` (`lxDef_exists`, Foundation `eval_ex`). Needed
    combinators (verifiable generalizations of the unary ones in `DescentSemantic`): `lxDef2_and`,
    `lxDef2_of_reduct`, `lxDef_exists`. Then `descent_seq_exists` is sorry-free → promote to `src/`.

**NEXT (wall C — after `hDdef`), hardest-first:**
1. **Build the `X`-descent `a : M → M`** from `no_min`/`ha₀`: `a 0 = a₀`, `a (k+1) =` `lx_least_number`
   applied to the `LX`-predicate `Q y := Mlt f y (a k) ∧ ¬MX y` (nonempty by `no_min`). This needs
   **M-internal recursion** so `a` is `LX`-definable as a function of `k` (Foundation `PR.Construction`,
   the way `igoodstein` was built — but the step is `X`-dependent, so it's an `LX`-recursion, not
   `ℒₒᵣ`-`𝚺₁`; check whether `PR.Construction` admits `LX`-formula steps or needs a bespoke
   sequence-coding (HFS `Seq`) argument). The `Mlt`-strict-descent + `¬MX`-along-`a` are then immediate.
2. **Slow-down `βₖ`** (Rathjen 3.3/3.4/Thm 3.5): from the `Mlt`-descent `(a k)` build `(βₖ)` with
   `C(βₖ) ≤ k+1`, as an `LX`-definable function. The ONote/`C` machinery is in `DescentCore`/`Domination`
   (route-neutral) — port the value facts to internal-`M`.
3. **Define `b k = T̂^{k+2}(βₖ)`, `m₀ = T̂²(β₀)`; prove `(hPdef, base, step, hpos)`** and feed
   `lx_nonterminating` ⟹ `hCD`. `step` is the internalized `DescentCore.ineq6_step`.

Wall B (the opaque `codeOfREPred` ↔ `igoodstein` bridge) is unchanged + literature-gated
(`ON-LINE-REQUEST.md`); independent of wall C/D.

## 🎯 LAP-31 (2026-06-23) — reduct→𝗜𝚺₁ bridge DONE + architecture correction (equality). Read FIRST.

**Verified this lap (green 1303 jobs, axiom-clean `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`):**
`src/GoodsteinPA/ReductModel.lean` (NEW). The lap-30 plan to run Rathjen §3 inside `M` via the lap-26
`igoodstein` substrate needs `M`'s `ℒₒᵣ`-reduct presented as `[ORingStructure M] [M ⊧ₘ* 𝗜𝚺₁]`. This
brick does it:
- `reductORing : ORingStructure M` — read off `M`'s `LX`-interpretation of the ring/order symbols.
- `reduct_eq_standardModel : inst.lMap Φ = @standardModel M reductORing` — via `standardModel_unique`
  (template: Foundation `FirstOrder/Arithmetic/TA/Nonstandard.lean`).
- `reduct_models_PA` / `reduct_models_isigma1` — `M ⊧ paLX ⟹ reduct ⊧ 𝗣𝗔 ⟹ ⊧ 𝗜𝚺₁`
  (via `lMap_PA_subset` + `modelsTheory_onTheory₁` + `models_of_subtheory` on `𝗜𝚺₁ ⪯ 𝗣𝗔`).

**⚠ ARCHITECTURE CORRECTION (the lap-30 plan understated this).** Two genuine subtleties for the
completeness route, BOTH must be handled before the substrate can run inside `M`:

1. **Equality (FULLY SCOPED lap 31 — see `ANALYSIS-2026-06-23-lap31-equality-architecture.md`).** The
   Tait `Derivation` calculus has NO equality rules (verified `Calculus.lean:20`), so
   `completeness_of_encodable` (used by `descentE`) gives models where `=` is an arbitrary relation,
   NOT real equality. The substrate needs real `=`. **Honest precondition = `[Structure.Eq LX M]`**
   (proved sufficient in `ReductModel`). To SUPPLY it, restrict to `[Structure.Eq]`-models via
   `EQ.provOf` (`Completeness/Corollaries.lean`) — which needs **`𝗘𝗤 ⪯ paLX`**. The EXACT gap = ONE
   axiom: **X-congruence `Theory.Eq.relExt Xsym` = `∀x y, x=y → X(x) → X(y)`** (the ℒₒᵣ-part of
   `𝗘𝗤(LX)` is `lMap Φ 𝗘𝗤(ℒₒᵣ)`, already in `lMap Φ 𝗣𝗔⁻ ⊆ paLX`; `𝗘𝗤 ⪯ paLX` `infer_instance`
   FAILS only for X-cong — verified). **NEXT-LAP TASK A**, two parts:
   - **A1 (the crux, deep-but-bounded):** augment `paLX` with X-congruence and re-validate
     `peano_not_proves_TI` — `hax_paLX` needs a NEW branch discharging X-congruence into the
     `PXFc`/`XFreeAx` `Z∞` carrier (it is NOT X-free, so `provable_true_x` doesn't apply; it's not an
     induction instance either). ONE simple true low-complexity axiom → a small bounded-ordinal `PXFc`
     derivation in `EmbeddingBound`/`EmbeddingX`. The `α`/cut-rank bound of `peano_not_proves_TI` is
     otherwise unchanged. This is the real new work; START it next lap.
   - **A2 (plumbing):** `EQ.provOf` + `completeness_of_encodable : T ⊨ φ → T ⊢ φ` + `Semiformula.toEmpty`
     of `TI prec` (`emb_toEmpty` un-coerces) + `provable_def`/`provable_iff_derivable2` → `Derivation2`.
     Fiddly/bounded. Blast radius: `paLX` is woven through 6 files — augmenting its def risks a red
     build; consider a separate `paLX'` (but `peano_not_proves_TI'` still re-runs the embedding, A1).

2. **Opaque headline blob ↔ transparent substrate (THE arithmetization wall).** `hgood` gives
   `reduct ⊧ goodsteinSentence`, and `goodsteinSentence = ∀⁰ (codeOfREPred goodsteinTerminates)` is an
   OPAQUE Foundation r.e.-code (`Encoding.lean`), NOT `∃N, igoodstein m N = 0`. They agree on ℕ
   (`InternalBridge`), but in a nonstandard `M` you need them **IΣ₁-provably equivalent** to use the
   descent contradiction. This is the #4 arithmetization wall (landscape doc). **NEXT-LAP TASK B**
   (deep): either (i) prove `IΣ₁ ⊢ codeOfREPred goodsteinTerminates m ↔ ∃N, igoodstein m N = 0`
   (needs the register-machine ↔ igoodstein computation internalized — very deep), or (ii) reconsider
   making `goodsteinSentence` a transparent igoodstein-Σ₁ form whose ℕ-faithfulness is `InternalBridge`
   (touches the audit surface `Encoding.lean`; Bridge.lean RHS is LOCKED so re-prove faithfulness with
   SAME RHS — `InternalBridge.igoodstein_nat` already supplies it). (ii) is architecturally cleaner but
   needs an anti-fraud review; do NOT do it silently.

**Remaining decomposition of `no_min_descent_absurd_of_goodstein` (the lone wall), hardest-first:**
- (A) reduct→𝗜𝚺₁ — ✅ DONE (this lap, modulo wiring `[Structure.Eq]` via Task A).
- (B) opaque↔transparent (Task B above) — deep, unstarted.
- (C) M-internal `Mlt`-descent from `no_min` via `M`'s LX least-number principle — deep, unstarted.
- (D) slow-down `βₖ`-definable + internal `ineq6` iteration (`DescentCore.ineq6_step` is the kernel) —
  deep; substrate (`igoodstein_nonterminating_of_dominating`) ready to consume `(b, step, hpos)`.

## 🎯 LAP-30 (2026-06-23) — STRATEGIC REDIRECT: the E wall = ONE semantic lemma via completeness. Read FIRST.

**The whole headline now reduces to a single model-theoretic statement.** Fresh-mind review found the
lap-27 plan ("Route B = hand-build the `paLX` sequent derivation of `TI_≺(X)`", literature-gated) is not
the cleanest path. Foundation's **first-order completeness** (`Derivation.completeness_of_encodable`,
general FO, on disk) produces `paLX ⟹ [TI prec]` from the semantic premise "every `M ⊧ paLX` models
`TI prec`". So `Thm56.DescentE` is now **PROVED** (`src/GoodsteinPA/DescentSemantic.lean`, NEW, green 1302
jobs) modulo ONE disclosed `sorry`:

```
paLX_models_TI_of_PA_provable (h : 𝗣𝗔 ⊢ ↑goodsteinSentence)
    {M} [Nonempty M] [Structure LX M] (hM : M ⊧ₘ* paLX) (f : ℕ → M) : Evalfm M f (TI prec)
```

`#print axioms descentE` = `#print axioms peano_not_proves_goodstein_modulo_semantic` =
`[propext, sorryAx, choice, Quot.sound, ONoteComp…native_decide.ax_1_5]` — **NO `PA_delta1Definable`, NO
custom axiom**. Discharge the one `sorry` ⟹ the headline is axiom-clean. (Built `LX.Encodable`: 4 small
instances, only `Encodable (XRel k)` was missing.) `Statement.lean` headline `sorry` UNTOUCHED (anti-fraud).

**Why it's correct (vs the superseded sequent plan):** (i) **resolves the free-`X` obstruction** — work in
models of `paLX` (where `X` is `M`'s relation), not `V ⊧ 𝗜𝚺₁`; completeness lifts to a derivation for free;
(ii) **no literature gate** — standard model theory, `ON-LINE-REQUEST.md` question is moot; (iii) **reuses
the lap-26 substrate** — `igoodstein`/`ibump` run in `M`'s `ℒₒᵣ`-reduct, `DescentCore.ineq6_step` is the
kernel. Full map in **`DESCENT-PLAN.md §5`**.

**PROGRESS (lap 30, all green + axiom-clean in `DescentSemantic.lean`):**
- **✅ Step 1 — `M ⊧ lMap goodsteinSentence`.** `models_lMap_goodstein` (E-lift + `provable_def` +
  `Semiformula.lMap_emb` + `models_of_provable` soundness) and `reduct_models_goodstein` (via
  `Semiformula.models_lMap`: `M`'s `ℒₒᵣ`-reduct ⊧ `goodsteinSentence`). Axiom-clean.
- **✅ Step 2 — unfold `TI prec` semantics in `M`.** `evalfm_TI_unfold` : `Evalfm M f (TI prec) ↔
  ((∀x, (∀y, Mlt f y x → MX y) → MX x) → ∀x, MX x)` — **abstract transfinite induction** for `(Mlt, MX)`,
  where `MX a := Structure.rel Xsym ![a]` (M's X) and `Mlt f y x := Eval M ![y,x] f Thm56.prec` (M's ≺).
  Pure `map_imply`/`eval_all`/`eval_rel₁` unfolding + `rfl`. The main lemma now `rw`s this and `intro`s
  progressivity; the lone `sorry` sits on the crisp goal `∀ x, MX x`.

**NEXT — the deep core (`DescentSemantic.lean:144`), hardest-first:** goal `∀ x : M, MX x` given
`hProg : ∀ x, (∀ y, Mlt f y x → MX y) → MX x` and Goodstein-in-`M`. Suppose `¬MX a₀`. Sub-obligations:
1. **M-internal `Mlt`-descent.** `Prog`-contrapositive: `∀x, ¬MX x → ∃y, Mlt y x ∧ ¬MX y`. Build the
   descending sequence **as an M-INTERNAL/definable object** (NOT metatheoretic `choice` — see ⚠ below):
   `G : M → M` by M-recursion, `G(k+1) = ≺`-least `y` with `Mlt y (G k) ∧ ¬MX y`, via `M`'s LX
   least-number principle. NEED: LNP for LX-formulas from `M ⊧ InductionScheme LX` (search Foundation for
   a semantic `leastNumber`/order-induction over models of induction, or derive it).
2. **`M`'s `ℒₒᵣ`-reduct as an `ORingStructure`/`𝗜𝚺₁` model.** `hM ⊧ paLX ⊇ lMap 𝗣𝗔` ⟹ reduct ⊧ `𝗣𝗔` ⊇
   `𝗜𝚺₁`. Bridge the reduct `inst.lMap Φ : Structure ℒₒᵣ M` into the substrate's `[ORingStructure M]
   [M ⊧ₘ* 𝗜𝚺₁]` (instance juggling: the substrate's `igoodstein` uses the ambient `ORingStructure`).
3. **Slow-down + inequality (6) in `M`.** Slow `(G k)` ⟹ `(βₖ)` (`C(βₖ) ≤ k+1`, Rathjen §3); run special
   Goodstein from `m₀ = T̂²(β₀)` (lap-26 `igoodstein` in the reduct); iterate `ineq6_step` by `M`'s
   induction ⟹ `M ⊧ ∀k mₖ > 0`; contradict Goodstein-in-`M`.

**⚠ THE key subtlety (M-internal vs external descent):** the descent must be **M-internal/definable**, not
built by Lean-level `choice` over real ℕ. An external `g : ℕ → M` makes inequality (6) hold only for
*standard* `k`, but `M ⊧ goodstein` gives termination at an `M`-natural `N` that may be *nonstandard* — the
external bound never reaches it. Building `G` M-internally (definable + M-recursion) makes the run align
with `M`'s internal termination statement. This is the crux of why the deep core is genuine work.

**Banked/superseded (true + green, keep in `src/`):** `DescentInternal.igoodstein_nonterminating_of_dominating`
and the `DescentArith`/`sigma1_pos_succ_induction` scaffold are the X-free `V ⊧ 𝗜𝚺₁` framing — their
arithmetic content transfers to step 3, but re-targeted to `M ⊧ paLX`. The internal-bump bricks
(`ibump_pos`, `le_ibump`, `ibump_gt`, + a still-needed `ibump_mono`) are reusable in `M`'s reduct.

## 🎯 LAP-29 (2026-06-23) — `InternalBridge` FINISHED: substrate faithfulness machine-checked. Read FIRST.

**Done this lap (green, 1300 jobs, axiom-clean `[propext, choice, Quot.sound]`):** the lap-28 parked
`ibump_nat`/`igoodstein_nat` bridges are now **theorems** in `src/GoodsteinPA/InternalBridge.lean`. The
internal `𝚺₁`-definable Goodstein substrate (`ibump`/`igoodstein` over a model `V`) is proven to compute
the **audited** `Defs.bump`/`Defs.goodsteinSeq` on the standard model `ℕ` — the anti-fraud faithfulness
link Route B relies on (the internal run is the genuine Goodstein process, not a look-alike).

**The Foundation-ℕ operation diamond is SOLVED** (the lap-28 blocker). Foundation declares `noncomputable
scoped` `Div`/`Mod`/`Sub` instances over any `PeanoMinus` model `V` (built from `Classical.choose!`),
which over `V=ℕ` are **distinct instances** from `Nat.instDiv`/`instMod`/`instSub` (NOT defeq for
`/`,`%`,`−`; only `+`,`*` and `OfNat 0/1` coincide — there is NO `instAdd_foundation`/`instMul_foundation`).
Three bridge lemmas convert them:
- `fdiv_nat`/`fmod_nat`/`fsub_nat` — must state the LHS with the **explicit Foundation instance**
  `@HDiv.hDiv ℕ ℕ ℕ (@instHDiv ℕ (@LO.FirstOrder.Arithmetic.instDiv_foundation ℕ _ _)) x d` (a bare `_`
  resolves to `Nat.instDiv`, the global winner — confirmed via pp.all probe). Proofs: `div_eq_of`
  (foundation) + Nat facts; `sub_spec_of_ge`/`sub_spec_of_le` (foundation) + `omega` (omega treats the
  foundation sub as an atom and the `+` as Nat's).
- **Gotcha:** `igoodstein_succ`'s `ibump (k+2) …` uses the generic `instOfNatAtLeastTwo` numeral (V was
  generic), NOT `instOfNatNat`, so `rw [ibump_nat (k+2) …]` won't match a freshly-written `k+2`; first
  `rw [fsub_nat]` to Natify the `−1`, then `show … (k+2) … = …` to re-cast the numeral (defeq), then
  the rewrite matches. (Saved to memory.)

Route-neutral / on the Route-B path (the substrate doubles as `LX`-formula builders). The ONE wall is
unchanged: **E-core(b) Route-B** (the integrated paLX descent), partially literature-gated (see
`ON-LINE-REQUEST.md` — the precise calculus-internal `Goodstein ⟹ paLX ⊢ TI_≺(X)` shape).

**Also landed lap 29 (`src/GoodsteinPA/DescentInternal.lean`, green, axiom-clean):** wired the bridged
internal run into the (6)-scaffold. `igoodstein_sigma1 (m₀) : 𝚺₁-Function₁ (igoodstein m₀)` (partial
application of `igoodstein_definable` via `DefinableFunction₂.comp`), and
`igoodstein_nonterminating_of_dominating` = `nonterminating_internal` specialized to `m := igoodstein
m₀`. **This makes the RUN side of E-core(b) axiom-clean and pins the precise remaining obligation: a
`𝚺₁`-bound `b k = T̂^{k+2}(βₖ)` with `(base, step, hpos)`.** `step` is the internalized `ineq6_step`
(numeral-Δ₀ form of `DescentCore.ineq6_step`); `b`/`βₖ` is the slow-down side, fed in Route B by the
`X`-definable descent from `¬TI prec`.

**Internal-arithmetic bricks STARTED (lap 29, green, axiom-clean) toward the internal `ineq6_step`:**
- `InternalPow.ipow_le_ipow_left` / `ipow_lt_ipow_left` — `ipow` (strict) monotone in the base.
- `InternalLog.ilog_pos` — `1 ≤ ilog b n` for `b ≤ n`.
- `InternalBump.ibump_pos` — the general positive-argument recursion (`ibump_succ` for arbitrary `0<n`).
- `InternalBump.le_ibump` — `n ≤ ibump b n` (Δ₀-numeral analogue of `Domination.le_bump`), via `𝚺₁`
  order-induction (`ISigma1.sigma1_order_induction`) peeling through `ibump_pos`.
- `InternalBump.ibump_gt` — `b ≤ n → n+1 ≤ ibump b n` (analogue of `Domination.bump_gt`), digit-direct.
- **NB1:** the ℕ proof of `bump_mono` goes *via ordinals* (`toOrdinal` StrictMono), NOT internalizable
  (`DESCENT-PLAN §3b`: avoid internal ONote) — internal `ibump_mono` needs a fresh **digit-direct** proof
  (genuinely subtle: comparing hereditary reps of `a ≤ a'`). This is the next hard chip.
- **NB2 (reusable):** `omega` and `ring` do **NOT** work over a generic model `V` (only `ℕ`/`Int`);
  `ring` is also not imported in the `Internal*` files. Use manual ordered-semiring lemmas
  (`add_le_add`, `mul_le_mul`, `add_right_comm`, `lt_iff_succ_le`, `pos_iff_one_le`, `le_iff_lt_succ`).

**NEXT (hardest-first, offline-tractable pieces):**
1. **Internal `ineq6_step`** (the `step` hyp): the genuine non-vacuous Π₁ kernel as a `Δ₀`-numeral fact
   inside `V` — base-`b` digit form (Rathjen 2.2(ii)), NOT internalized ONote (`DESCENT-PLAN §3b`).
   Build on `ibump` (bridged) + `le_ibump` + internal `ibump`-monotonicity (digit-direct) + internal
   `ibump_gt` (`b ≤ n → n+1 ≤ ibump b n`). Deep, multi-lap; the irreducible content.
2. **The `b`/`βₖ` side**: requires the descending input. In Route B this is `X`-definable from `¬TI
   prec` — literature-gated on the exact paLX shape (`ON-LINE-REQUEST.md`).
3. **Route-B paLX glue**: from `¬TI prec` (free-`X`) extract the descent via the LX least-number scheme;
   contradict the lifted `goodsteinSentence` via `igoodstein_nonterminating_of_dominating`. Skeleton-
   decompose into named `wip/` obligations once the paLX shape is pinned.

## 🎯 LAP-28 (2026-06-23) — F-φ DISCHARGED (in build). ONE wall left: E-core(b) Route-B. Read FIRST.

**Done this lap:** F-φ ported + wired (`src/GoodsteinPA/ONoteComp.lean`); `peano_not_proves_TI` is now
fully axiom-clean (mod trust base + 1 🟢 `native_decide`). The project has **exactly one wall: `DescentE`**
(`Thm56.lean:133`) — the integrated paLX Route-B construction (`𝗣𝗔 ⊢ goodstein → paLX ⊢ TI prec`).

**Attempted + parked (off-critical-path):** the route-neutral faithfulness bricks `ibump_nat`/
`igoodstein_nat` in `InternalBridge.lean` (PENDING-26 NEXT). The math is straightforward strong
induction matching `ibump_succ`/`Defs.bump`, BUT it hit a **Foundation-ℕ operation diamond**: Foundation's
`/`,`%` on a model `V` are `noncomputable scoped instance`s built from `Classical.choose!`
(`IOpen/Basic.lean:86,260`), so over `V=ℕ` they are **NOT defeq** to `Nat.div`/`Nat.mod` (instances
`instDiv_foundation`/`instMod_foundation` ≠ `Nat.instDiv`/`Nat.instMod`). `ipow_nat`/`ilog_nat` work
because `ipow`/`ilog` are hand-built (bridged by their own induction); but `ibump_succ` exposes raw V-`/`,`%`.
- **The fix (next lap):** build two bridge lemmas `Vdiv_nat`/`Vmod_nat` (Foundation `/`,`%` over ℕ = Nat's)
  via `LO.FirstOrder.Arithmetic.div_eq_of` (`hb : b*c ≤ a`, `ha : a < b*(c+1)` ⟹ `a/b = c`) + `rem_graph`
  / `div_add_mod` (`IOpen/Basic.lean:106,267,275`), feeding Nat facts (`Nat.mul_div_le`,
  `Nat.lt_div_add_one_mul_self`) through `le_def`. CAUTION: the scoped Foundation `Div`/`Mod` lose to
  Nat's global instance in plain `a / b` notation — must state the bridges with explicit
  `@HDiv.hDiv ℕ ℕ ℕ <foundation-inst>`. Then `ibump_nat` closes (the `*`,`+` ARE defeq; only `/`,`%` need it).
- This is **route-neutral** (faithfulness link to audited `Defs`), NOT the headline crux. Do it only as
  warm-up / when E-core stalls.

## 🎯 LAP-27 (2026-06-23) — DEEP REFLECTION: F-φ SOLVED on Aristotle; back-end DECIDED = Route B. Read FIRST.

Full synthesis in **`REFLECTION-2026-06-23.md`**. Two changes the grind laps inherit:

**(1) F-φ is solved — PORT IN PROGRESS (`wip/aristotle-fphi/`).** Aristotle proved
`rePred_ltPull_natCode` (verified faithful: verbatim our statement + our `natCode`). **Port started lap
27** (`ONoteComp.v431-port-wip.lean`): reuses our `Epsilon0Complete` scaffolding, 4 proofs fixed, the
`native_decide +revert` >10min hang resolved. **~12 proofs still break on v4.28→v4.31 drift** — full
error analysis + fix recipe + compile-time strategy (low-heartbeat diagnostic; full build is >10min) in
**`wip/aristotle-fphi/PORT-STATUS.md`**. The disclosed `axiom` stays in `SeamDefinability.lean` (TRUE +
PROVEN, honest 🟡) until the port is green. **Mechanical multi-lap port — NOT the crux.** When green:
wire into the lib + SeamDefinability, confirm `#print axioms peano_not_proves_TI =
[propext, choice, Quot.sound]` (+ ≤2 🟢 `native_decide`). If it stays painful (see PORT-STATUS),
deprioritize vs E-core (the actual crux).

**(2) Back-end DECIDED: Route B. STOP the internal-V induction-toward-headline.** The lap 25–26
`DescentArith.ineq6_internal` (`sigma1_pos_succ_induction`) lands X-free `𝗣𝗔 ⊢ PRWO(ε₀)` = **Route A's**
antecedent; it **cannot** feed the built `peano_not_proves_TI` (free-`X` obstruction — exactly the
lap-24 correction; `𝗣𝗔 ⊢ PRWO`/primrec can't refute the X-definable counterexample to `TI prec`, and
E-lift can't make the free `X`). Route A also carries `PA_delta1Definable` (🟡), which anti-fraud
forbids on the headline. **So:**
- **KEEP** the lap-26 arithmetic substrate (`InternalPow/Digits/Log/Bump/Goodstein` + `InternalBridge`)
  — it encodes Goodstein arithmetic as definable formulas, needed by Route B too (~70% transfers).
  **Finish `InternalBridge`** (`ibump_nat`, `igoodstein_nat`) — faithfulness link to `Defs`, route-neutral.
- **STOP** extending `DescentArith.ineq6_internal` toward the headline. It's a true lemma (stays in
  `src/`, green), but it's Route-A-flavored and off the clean-headline path.
- **START** E-core(b) the **Route-B way:** inside a paLX derivation, set up the X-definable descent from
  `¬TI prec` (LX least-number scheme), define the Goodstein run from it via the lap-26 substrate (now as
  `LX`-formula builders), and run inequality (6) as an **`InductionScheme LX`** step (NOT
  `sigma1_pos_succ_induction`), contradicting the lifted X-free `goodsteinSentence` at the X-definable
  seed `m₀ = T̂²(β₀)`. This is the integrated paLX construction the lap-24 correction named — the last wall.

**Fallback endpoint (if E-core(b) Route-B proves intractable after sustained effort):** state E-core as
ONE narrow cited axiom (`DescentE`) on top of the built monument + F — a legitimate, valuable artifact,
and strictly better than Route A's `PA_delta1Definable` + unbuilt `PRWO ⟹ Con(PA)`.

## 🎯 LAP-26 (2026-06-23) — E-core(b) "THE WALL" CRACKED: internal `bump`/`goodsteinSeq` BUILT. Read FIRST.

The lap-25 gating prereq ("make `bump`/`goodsteinSeq` `𝚺₁`-definable inside `V`") is **DONE + axiom-clean**.
Five new files (`InternalPow`/`InternalDigits`/`InternalLog`/`InternalBump`/`InternalGoodstein`) build the
internal Goodstein substrate via Foundation's `PR.Construction` (base-2-only `Exponential` forced a hand-built
`ipow`). Highlights: `ilog_defined : 𝚺₁-Function₂`, `ibump` (table reduction of the course-of-values bump) with
the **proven peel recursion `ibump_succ` = `Defs.bump`**, and `igoodstein` = the concrete `m : V → V` for
`DescentArith.ineq6_internal`. Faithfulness bridge started (`InternalBridge`: `ipow_nat`, `ilog_nat`). Full
details + resolved gotchas (aesop-can't-do-ibumpTable → explicit `comp` terms; LE diamond on ℕ → `le_def`) in
**`HANDOFF-2026-06-23-lap26.md`**. Build green 1280 jobs; headline `sorry` intact.

**NEXT (hardest-first):** (1) finish `InternalBridge` (`ibump_nat` by `Nat.strong_induction_on`,
`igoodstein_nat`) — anti-fraud link to audited `Defs`. (2) **THE math content:** internal `ineq6_step`
(Rathjen Lemma 3.6 slow-down) — build `b k = T̂^{k+2}∘βₖ` as `𝚺₁`-fn, prove base + step, plug `m=igoodstein`
into `DescentArith.ineq6_internal`. (3) back-end (Route A/B, deferred). (4) F-φ on Aristotle.

## 🎯 LAP-24 (2026-06-23) — E-core kernel landed + back-end correction. Read FIRST.

**Two walls left: E-core + F-φ** (D' discharged lap 22; E-lift X-free half done lap 23). Build green
1271 jobs; headline `sorry` intact. F-φ on Aristotle (`aris_onotecmp`, running). See refreshed
`STATUS.md` + `DESCENT-PLAN.md §3a` (Σ₁-completeness reframe) + `DESCENT-PLAN.md §1 CORRECTION`.

**✅ Landed this lap (`src/GoodsteinPA/DescentCore.lean`, axiom-clean):** `Dom.ineq6_step` — the
non-vacuous Π₁ kernel of Rathjen Lemma 3.6 (one special Goodstein step from `m ≥ T̂^{k+2}_ω(βₖ)` lands
`≥ T̂^{k+3}_ω(β_{k+1})`), + `lemma36_ineq6`/`lemma36_nonterminating` (the `∀k` iteration — **semantic
shadow only**, vacuous hypotheses since ε₀ is well-founded; the real content is the arithmetization).
Weakened `Domination.canon_repr` `2≤b → 1≤b` (base-2 `T̂²_ω` needs `evalNat 1`).

**⚠️ Back-end correction (lap 24).** The DESCENT-PLAN's "`PRWO ⟹ TI prec` = one X-instance" understated
the Route-B bridge: Rathjen's `PRWO(ε₀)` is the **primrec** well-ordering statement (Thm 2.8), and a
counterexample to the free-X `TI prec` yields an **X-definable** (not primrec) descent, so primrec-`PRWO`
can't refute `TI prec` directly. The honest Route-B bridge = carry out Rathjen §3 **inside paLX** with the
free-X descent (LX least-number scheme + inequality (6), contradicting the lifted X-free Goodstein at the
X-definable seed). **De-risking:** `Goodstein ⟹ PRWO(ε₀)` (Rathjen §3) is **shared by both back-ends**
(Route A `PRWO ⟹ Con(PA)` + Gödel II, costs `PA_delta1Definable`; Route B the integrated paLX construction,
axiom-clean). **Focus E-core on the shared §3; defer the back-end choice.** Lit request filed
(`ON-LINE-REQUEST.md` lap 24) to pin the cheaper back-end.

**✅ Landed lap 25 (`DescentCore.lean`, axiom-clean):** Rathjen's tower `ωₙ` (`omegaStack`: `ω₀=1`,
`ωₙ₊₁=ω^{ωₙ}`) + `omegaStack_NF`, `C_omegaStack : C(ωₙ)=1`, `repr_omegaStack_succ`,
`repr_omegaStack_strictMono` (the Thm 3.5 head-term scaffold). **✅ Also landed lap 25 (`DescentCore.lean`, axiom-clean):** the C-arithmetic for the tail terms —
`one_add_oadd` (`1 + oadd e' n' a'` evaluation), `C_one_add_le : C(1+e) ≤ C(e)+1`, and the headline
`C_omega_mul_le : C(ω·α) ≤ C(α)+1` (= Rathjen's "multiplying by ω bumps coeffs by ≤1"; `omegaO := oadd 1 1 0`,
induction on the `ONote.mul` recursion). **✅ Also landed lap 25 (`DescentCore.lean`, axiom-clean):** the Thm 3.5 tail-term `C`-bound, complete —
`C_ofNat`, `one_add_ne_zero`, `NoFin`/`noFin_omega_mul` (ω·α has no finite part), `C_add_ofNat_le`
(`C(a+finite) ≤ max(C a, finite)` for `NoFin` NF `a`; mirrors `add_nfBelow` with cmp-gt), `NF_omegaO`,
and the headline **`C_betaTail_le : C(ω·αₙ + (K-i)) ≤ K(n+1)+i+1`** (= `C(βᵣ)≤r+1` for the tail block,
given `C(αₙ)≤K(n+1)`, `i<K`). **✅ Tail-block DESCENT done lap 25 (`DescentCore.lean`, axiom-clean):** `repr_omegaO` (repr ω=ω),
`repr_betaTail_within` (larger finite tail → larger value), `repr_betaTail_boundary`
(`ω·αₙ₊₁+K < ω·αₙ` from `αₙ₊₁≺αₙ`; ω absorbs the finite K). **Both halves of Thm 3.5's TAIL block —
`C(βᵣ)≤r+1` and `βᵣ₊₁<βᵣ` — are now machine-checked.** This is the asymptotic (non-vacuous) content.

**ARITHMETIZATION MAP VERIFIED lap 25 (see `DESCENT-PLAN.md §3b`):** the inequality-(6) PA-induction is
feasibility-confirmed — `sigma_one_completeness` (Σ₁ free) and `sigma1_pos_succ_induction` (the internal
`𝗜𝚺₁` induction; `succ` = internal `ineq6_step`) both exist with verified signatures; `P(k):=mₖ≥T̂^{k+2}(βₖ)`
is Δ₀ hence a `𝚺₁-Predicate`, so the induction applies directly. **The one gating prerequisite = make
`bump`/`goodsteinSeq`/`T̂`/`βₖ` `𝚺₁`-definable *inside* `V`** (the `PA_delta1Definable`-flavoured gap, here
only for the concrete primrec `bump` the repo already has `computable_bump` for). 

**✅ Arithmetization SCAFFOLD machine-checked lap 25 (`src/GoodsteinPA/DescentArith.lean`, axiom-clean,
now in the lib build).** `ineq6_internal` : inside `[V ⊧ₘ* 𝗜𝚺₁]`, given `𝚺₁`-functions `m,b`, base
`b 0 ≤ m 0`, and the internal step, `sigma1_pos_succ_induction` yields `∀k, b k ≤ m k` — the `definability`
tactic discharges the `𝚺₁`-predicate automatically. `nonterminating_internal` adds `0<b k ⟹ 0<m k`
(the PA-internal Lemma 3.6). **The inequality-(6) induction now assembles in Lean**; the deep layer is
isolated behind the two `𝚺₁`-function hyps + the step. Also: wired `DescentLift`/`DescentCore`/`DescentArith`
into `src/GoodsteinPA.lean` (build 1271→1274 jobs).

**Next bricks (priority):** (1) **THE WALL — internalized definability:** supply the concrete `𝚺₁`-function
`m` = internalized `goodsteinSeq`/`bump` (build on Foundation `𝗜𝚺₁` `log`/`exp`/`bexp` in
`Arithmetic/Exponential/`; `bump` is base-b digit manipulation) + `b` = `T̂^{k+2}∘β`, and prove the
internal `ineq6_step` (`Δ₀` numeral form of `DescentCore.ineq6_step`), then plug into `ineq6_internal`.
Multi-lap. (2) Optional completeness: the Thm 3.5 HEAD block (`βⱼ=Σω_{s-i}`,
`j<K`) — a finite boundary detail, vacuous on its own; `headBeta s t := oadd (omegaStack (s-1)) 1
(headBeta (s-1) t)`, `C=1` from `C_omegaStack`, descent by `repr_add`. Low value vs (1).

**Next concrete bricks (route-independent §3):** (1) the slow-down constructions Rathjen Lemma 3.3 / Cor
3.4 / Thm 3.5 — the explicit padding function `g : ℕ² → ω^ω` and the bounded-coefficient sequence `βⱼ`,
with their *step* properties (descending-at-a-step, `C(βᵣ)≤r+1`) as non-vacuous finite ℕ/ONote facts
(Lemma 3.2 = mathlib `exists_lt_ack_of_nat_primrec`). (2) Then the arithmetization: inequality (6)'s `∀k`
as a genuine PA-induction (the dominant wall; Σ₁ glue is free via `sigma_one_completeness`).
**Landed lap 24:** `Dom.C : ONote → ℕ` (Rathjen's max-coefficient) + `Canon_iff_C_le` (`Canon b o ↔ C o ≤ b`).

### Arithmetization API — GROUNDED (lap 24 scoping of the dominant wall)

Scoped Foundation's machinery for the inequality-(6) PA-induction (E-core's irreducible core). Findings:
- **Σ₁ glue is free:** `LO.FirstOrder.Arithmetic.sigma_one_completeness {σ : Sentence ℒₒᵣ}
  (hσ : Hierarchy 𝚺 1 σ) : ℕ ⊧ₘ σ → T ⊢ σ` (for `[𝗥₀ ⪯ T]`, so `𝗣𝗔`) — every TRUE Σ₁ sentence is
  PA-provable (`R0/Basic.lean:146`). This is the engine `precφ`/F-φ already rides (`codeOfREPred₂` →
  `sigma_one_completeness_iff`). All Δ₀/Σ₁ *computations* (specific Goodstein/`T̂`/βₖ values) are free.
- **The inductive core is the genuine work.** `∀k (mₖ ≥ T̂^{k+2}(βₖ))` is Π₁ (∀ of Δ₀) — NOT free. It
  needs a PA-induction. Foundation's idiom = the **internalized-model approach**
  (`Arithmetic/Induction.lean`: `sigma1_pos_succ_induction`, `bounded_all_sigma1_order_induction`, …):
  work inside an arbitrary `V ⊧ 𝗜𝚺₁` with `𝚺₁`-definable predicates/functions, do internal induction,
  and the framework yields the `𝗜𝚺₁`/`𝗣𝗔` proof.
- **KEY SIMPLIFICATION — arithmetize over base-b NUMERALS, not internalized ONote.** Rathjen's whole
  framework is numeral-based: `T̂^b_ω(α)`/`S^b_c` are base-conversions on numerals, and the order
  comparison is base-b *digit* comparison (Lemma 2.2(ii)), which is **Δ₀** (PA-provable directly). The
  ordinal/ONote/`repr`/ε₀ detour is only the *semantic* (ZFC-side) proof convenience (e.g. `ineq6_step`
  via `evalNat_lt_iff`/`canon_repr`); the **PA-side proof of inequality (6) uses Δ₀ numeral comparison**
  and avoids internalizing ONote into `V`. This is the big de-risk vs re-implementing ONote in HFS.
- **Prerequisite chain:** (i) the Goodstein function `goodsteinSeq` is already arithmetized
  (`Encoding.lean`/`goodsteinSentence`); (ii) the slow-down sequence `βₖ` + `T̂^{k+2}` as `𝚺₁`/primrec
  numeral functions (define from the Lean fns via `codeOfREPred`, or hand-build in `IΣ₁`); (iii) the
  arithmetized `ineq6_step` (Δ₀ numeral comparison); (iv) internal induction (`sigma1_pos_succ_induction`)
  to land `𝗣𝗔 ⊢ ∀k ψ(k)`; (v) the back-end (Route A/B, deferred). **(ii)–(iv) are the multi-lap wall.**

---

## 🎯 LAP-23 (2026-06-23) — E decomposition GROUNDED + first E-lift bricks LANDED.

Read **`DESCENT-PLAN.md`** (new, this lap): the full E wall mapped from Rathjen 2014 §2–3 to repo defs,
with the exact Foundation E-lift bricks (`Derivation.lMap`, `provable_iff_derivable2`,
`Derivation.toDerivation2`) verified present, and the **X-essential subtlety** spelled out (`TI prec`
mentions the set variable `X`, so it is NOT the `lMap` of any `ℒₒᵣ` sentence — E genuinely needs the
X-induction instance, not just proof-translation).

**✅ X-FREE E-LIFT COMPLETE (axiom-clean, `src/GoodsteinPA/DescentLift.lean`, `#print axioms =
[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`).** The full proof-translation half of E-lift is machine-
checked: **`paLX_derivable2_lMap_of_PA_provable : 𝗣𝗔 ⊢ σ → Nonempty (Derivation2 paLX {lMap Φ ↑σ})`**.
The chain, all landed:
- `lMap_{zero,one}_const`, `lMap_succT`, **`lMap_succInd`** — `lMap` commutes with the induction-axiom
  builder (the operator-`lMap` leaves, proved symbol-by-symbol since there is **no
  `Semiterm.lMap_operator` lemma**; also **`fin_cases` is NOT available** in this build — use
  `Fin.cases`/`.elim0`).
- `fvSup_lMap`, `lMap_fixitr`, `lMap_univCl'`, **`lMap_univCl`** — `lMap` commutes with universal closure.
- **`lMap_inductionScheme_subset`** : `lMap (InductionScheme ℒₒᵣ univ) ⊆ InductionScheme LX univ`.
- `lMap_PA_subset`, `coe_schema_lMap`, `schema_lMap_PA_subset` — `(𝗣𝗔:Schema).lMap Φ ⊆ (paLX:Schema)`.
- The lift: `provable_def` → `Derivation.lMap` → schema-weaken → `provable_iff_derivable2`.

**E-core brick landed** (`src/GoodsteinPA/DescentCore.lean`, axiom-clean): `evalNat_lt_iff` /
`evalNat_le_iff` / `evalNat_lt_of_lt` — Rathjen Lemma 2.3(iii), `evalNat` (= `T̂^b_ω`) order-reflects
on the `Canon`/`NF` domain (immediate from the already-present `Domination.canon_repr` round-trip +
`toOrdinal` strict monotonicity, also added `toOrdinal_lt_iff`/`le_iff`). **Note:** `Domination.lean`
is far more developed than the lap-22 map implied — it already has `Canon`/`Good`/`canon_repr`/
`canon_round_trip` (the full T̂/T round-trip) plus the entire `goodsteinLength ~ fastGrowingε₀` growth
analysis. Grep it before building any semantic ONote/Goodstein lemma.

**Next (E-core — the real remaining content):** the **X-essential** step `𝗣𝗔 ⊢ goodstein → Derivation2
paLX {TI prec}`. `TI prec` mentions the set variable `X` so it is NOT an `lMap`-image (the lift above
does NOT produce it directly). Path: (a) `𝗣𝗔 ⊢ goodsteinSentence → 𝗣𝗔 ⊢ ⌜PRWO(ε₀)⌝` (Rathjen §3
slowing-down, formalized inside PA — the dominant wall; first bricks: `C : ONote → ℕ` + `evalNat`
order-monotonicity, Aristotle-eligible), then (b) the X-induction instance `PRWO ⟹ TI prec` in `paLX`
(one least-number/induction instance for the `X`-formula — the lift's schema inclusion already gives
`paLX` those axioms). See `DESCENT-PLAN.md §1, §3`.

## 🎯 LAP-22 (2026-06-23) — D' DISCHARGED + E (DescentE) MAPPED FROM RATHJEN. Read FIRST.

**D' is closed.** `Thm56.embed_TI_bounded` is now machine-checked (the embedded ordinal `< ε₀`); the
entire `EmbeddingBound.lean` chain is axiom-clean. `#print axioms peano_not_proves_TI` = `[propext,
choice, Quot.sound, rePred_ltPull_natCode]` — `sorryAx` GONE. **Walls left: F-φ (Aristotle) + E.**

### E = `DescentE` decomposition (grounded in Rathjen-2014 "Goodstein revisited" §2-3, read lap 22)

`DescentE := 𝗣𝗔 ⊢ ↑goodsteinSentence → Nonempty (Derivation2 paLX {TI prec})`. The math (Rathjen):
Goodstein's theorem is **PA-equivalent to PRWO(ε₀)** (no descending prim-rec sequences of ordinals `<ε₀`,
= transfinite induction), and `𝗣𝗔 ⊬ PRWO(ε₀)` by Gentzen+Gödel-II. The two halves:

1. **The SEMANTIC descent is ALREADY in the repo** (`Domination.lean`, axiom-clean):
   - `toOrdinal b n` = Rathjen's `T^b_ω(m)` (base-`b` rep → CNF ordinal); `repr_toONote` ties it to `ONote`.
   - `seqOrd m k := toOrdinal (k+2) (goodsteinSeq m k)`; **`seqOrd_step` = Rathjen eq. (4)** — the ordinal
     strictly DECREASES along a Goodstein sequence (`goodsteinSeq m k ≠ 0 → seqOrd m (k+1) < seqOrd m k`).
   - `goodstein_terminates` (the (ii)⟹(i) direction, semantic) is fully proven.
   This is the **backbone**; E does NOT need to redo it.

2. **The SYNTACTIC gap (E's real content):** realize "Goodstein ⟹ TI(≺)" as a `Derivation2 paLX`
   proof-object, i.e. lift the semantic descent to a Z-proof of `TI prec`. Sub-lemmas (attack order):
   - **E-lift:** a finitary `𝗣𝗔`(ℒₒᵣ)-proof of an arithmetic `TI`/`PRWO(ε₀)` statement maps to a
     `Derivation2 paLX` of `TI prec` (proof-translation along `ℒₒᵣ ↪ LX`; `paLX ⊇ lMap 𝗣𝗔⁻ + induction`;
     match the arithmetic well-ordering formula to Buchholz's `TI prec = Prog prec 🡒 ∀⁰ Xat #0`, the
     set-variable `X` = the induction predicate). Mechanical-ish but needs the ℒₒᵣ `TI(ε₀)` formula DEFINED.
   - **E-core (the deep part):** `𝗣𝗔 ⊢ Goodstein ⟹ 𝗣𝗔 ⊢ TI(ε₀)` (Rathjen Cor 2.7 (i)⟹(ii), the
     reversal). Needs §3 "slowing down" (Lemma 3.2 Grzegorczyk bound, Lemma 3.3/Cor 3.4: convert arbitrary
     descending prim-rec sequences to SLOW ones `|αᵢ| ≤ K·(i+1)`, since PA only expresses prim-rec sequences).
   - **ALT (Route A escape hatch):** `Reduction.goodstein_implies_consistency : 𝗣𝗔 ⊢ γ → 𝗣𝗔 ⊢ Con(𝗣𝗔)`
     (Rathjen Thm 2.8: PRA ⊢ PRWO(ε₀)→Con(PA)) then Gödel II. Reintroduces `PA_delta1Definable` (🟡).
   - **First concrete prerequisite to formalize next lap:** the ℒₒᵣ-arithmetic statement of `PRWO(ε₀)` /
     `TI(ε₀)` + Rathjen Lemma 2.3 (the `T^b_ω`/`T̂^ω_b` order-iso, mostly in `toOrdinal_mono_and_bound`).
   - Scaffold (sorried statements) belongs in `wip/Descent.lean` (keeps `src/` sorry-free for the gate).

## ✅ LAP-19 (2026-06-22) — F ORDER-TYPE WALL CLOSED (axiom-clean). Read FIRST.

The order-type half of **F** is **DONE + `#print axioms`-clean** in `src/GoodsteinPA/Epsilon0Complete.lean`
(build green, 1268 jobs). This was the campaign's dominant risk (laps 12-19: "the real F girder mathlib
LACKS"). Landed, in dependency order:
1. `exists_NF_repr_eq : ∀ o<ε₀, ∃ x:ONote, x.NF ∧ x.repr=o` — ε₀-completeness of CNF notations (CNF
   recursion via `WellFoundedLT.induction`; key step `log_omega0_lt_self` = no ω^· fixed point below ε₀).
2. `repr_lt_epsilon0` (NF ⟹ repr<ε₀, induction on ONote) + `range_NONote_repr` (= `Iio ε₀`).
3. `rk_ltPull_eq_repr` (= seam-advice `note_rank_eq_repr`) + `epsilon0_le_orderType_ltPull (e : ℕ≃NONote)`
   — `ε₀ ≤ orderType (ltPull e)`. Proved by naming `orderType`/`rk` itself as some `repr (e n₀)` via
   surjectivity ⟹ NO Iio-sup identity, NO universe bump (all `Ordinal.{0}`; the `NONote ≃o Iio ε₀` route
   would land in `Ordinal.{1}` ≠ project's `orderType`).
4. `encodeONote`/`decodeONote` (computable `Encodable ONote`; ONote only derives DecidableEq) + `Infinite`/
   `Denumerable NONote` ⟹ `natCode : ℕ ≃ NONote` + `epsilon0_le_orderType_natCode` (concrete `Seam.ge`).

**F now reduces to ONE Foundation-side wire-up** (Worker B): the X-free `ℒₒᵣ` formula `φ : Semiformula ℒₒᵣ ℕ 2`
(via `codeOfREPred₂` from `codeOfPartrec'`) defining **`natCode`'s order** (`ltPull natCode`), then instantiate
`GoodsteinPA.EpsilonOrder.Seam` with `φ`, `hφ`, and `ge := epsilon0_le_orderType_natCode`. The definability
half (`hprec`/`hprecXPos`) is already discharged (lap 18, `EpsilonOrder.lean`). **Binding constraint:** `φ` must
define the SAME order `natCode` induces (`repr(natCode a) < repr(natCode b)` — express arithmetically via the
computable `ONote.cmp` on codes, since `<` itself routes through noncomputable `repr`).

### Remaining open obligations (priority for lap 20+)
- **C₂ glue `hax_paLX`** X-induction case (`EmbeddingX.lean:705`) — closes **Thm 5.6 (`PA ⊬ TI(ε₀)`)**
  axiom-clean modulo E+F. Recipe inlined at the sorry (steps 1-7); all four helper lemmas proven
  (`metaInduction_cong`, `subst_value_subst`, `succInd_nnf`, `PXFc_allClosure`). Friction = Foundation-DSL
  Rew-pushing through `succInd`/`univCl`/`fixitr` (steps 3-5). ALL-OR-NOTHING (can't partial-commit the sorry);
  extract step-4 `rew_succInd : g ▹ succInd ψ = succInd (g.q ▹ ψ)` as a standalone helper first.
- **F-definability `φ`** (Worker B, Foundation-side) — see above. Independent of C₂ glue and E.
- **E**: Goodstein⟹TI_≺(natCode order) in PA — the other unstarted wall. Per seam-advice Reviewer-2 §3:
  commit to `natCode`'s CNF order for BOTH F and E; E uses `Domination.toONote` as a descent MAP into it
  (E's order need not have type ε₀, only a PA-provable strictly-decreasing descent). Needs papers/ reading.

## Reflection — 2026-06-22 (lap 18, deep-reflection) — the F seam, grounded vs an outside attack plan

**Context.** Evaluated an external (GPT-5.5) attack plan for **F** (the arithmetization seam,
`‖≺‖=ε₀` + discharge `hprec`/`hprecXPos`) against the real repo + mathlib. The plan is largely
sound (it read the code: its `EpsilonOrder.hprec` reproduces `Boundedness.lean:699-702` exactly), but
it under-scopes the hard part and omits the E-coupling. Verified facts + corrected attack below.

**Direction call: KEEP the Buchholz Boundedness route; it is working.** As of lap 17 the *entire
machine from D back is machine-checked and `#print axioms`-clean*: Boundedness (Thm 5.4) + corollary B,
C₁ `PXFc.cutElim`→cr0, D `orderType_le_of_TIprovable`, C₂-structural `embedC_LX_gen`, M4 `embedC`,
M5 `cutElim`. The honest realistic endpoint: **headline reduced to two well-scoped girders — E
(Goodstein⟹TI) and F (arithmetization seam) — atop a fully-built, axiom-clean infinitary
proof-theory core.** That is a valuable, net-new-in-Lean endpoint even if F lands as one narrow
cited fact + built remainder. Remaining open obligations, in priority order:
1. **C₂ glue** `hax_paLX` induction case (`EmbeddingX.lean:705`) — pure integration, recipe inlined
   at the sorry (lap-17 HANDOFF #3). ~1 lap. Closes **Thm 5.6 (`PA ⊬ TI(ε₀)`)** axiom-clean modulo E+F.
2. **F-girder: ε₀-completeness of CNF notations** — the real wall (below). Mathlib-only ⟹ Aristotle-eligible.
3. **E**: Goodstein ⟹ TI_≺(X) — and it *constrains which ≺ F may use* (coupling, below).

### F attack — corrected (what the outside plan got right / wrong, verified)
- ✅ **Seam structure** (abstract `hprec`/`hprecXPos` into a record so F proceeds in parallel) — good.
  FIX 1: `orderType lt = ε₀` is stronger than needed; the contradiction only needs **`ε₀ ≤ orderType lt`**
  (D gives `‖≺‖ ≤ 2^β`, `β<ε₀`). The `≤ε₀`/embedding obligation is then free to drop.
  FIX 2: carry the **X-free ℒₒᵣ defining formula** `φ` (set `prec := φ.lMap (ORing.embedding LX)`), so
  `hprecXPos : XPos (∼prec)` is *automatic* (X-free ⟹ XPos, `XPositive.lean:18`), not a separate field.
- ✅ **`hprec` reduces to definability** — `hprec_of_lMap_defined`. `TruthSem.models_lMap`
  (`TruthSem.lean:120`, closed case) + the `levelSet lt γ={n|rk<γ}` interpretation (`TruthSem.lean:51`)
  already exist; after unfolding `hyp prec=∀⁰(prec🡒Xat #0)` every `prec` occurrence is a *closed*
  instance, so the closed `models_lMap` suffices (no need to generalize it to arity-2). **TRACTABLE —
  do this FIRST among F bricks. Foundation-side.**
- ✅ **`codeOfREPred₂` via `codeOfPartrec'`** — verified real: `Foundation/.../R0/Representation.lean:233`
  `codeOfPartrec' {k} : (Vector ℕ k →. ℕ)→Semisentence ℒₒᵣ (k+1)`; `:245 codeOfREPred`+`:250` spec is the
  unary template. Binary version constructible. (Our `lt` is computable — NONote `cmp` is decidable.)
- 🔴 **THE under-scope — `note_rank_eq_repr : rank(·<·) o = repr o` is NOT a mathlib wire-up.** It is
  **equivalent to completeness of the notation system up to ε₀** (every ordinal `<ε₀` is some `repr`),
  and **mathlib does NOT have that.** `Mathlib/SetTheory/Ordinal/Notation.lean` (1298 lines) proves only
  that `repr` is order-preserving + injective on `NF` (an *embedding* `NONote↪ε₀`: `lt_def:111`,
  `repr_inj:319`) — no surjectivity/`ofOrdinal`/order-type lemma. The embedding gives `rank o ≤ repr o`
  and `orderType ≤ ε₀` cheaply; the `=`/`≥` direction is the missing girder. **And the FIX-1 relaxation
  does NOT save you**: `ε₀ ≤ orderType lt` still needs the represented set to fill `[0,ε₀)` (cof ε₀ = ω,
  so a cofinal ω-chain has order type ω, not ε₀). ⟹ **formalize `∀ o<ε₀, ∃ x:ONote, x.NF ∧ x.repr=o`
  (CNF existence up to ε₀). ~1–3 laps. Pure mathlib ordinal arith, ZERO Foundation dep ⟹ the one piece
  of this project genuinely well-suited to ARISTOTLE** (contra the lap-17 blanket "poor fit").
  - The outside plan's "Domination.lean has `towerO/repr_towerO/exists_repr_lt_omegaTower`" is **wrong**
    — those names don't exist. Repo has `toONote`/`repr_toONote`/`toONote_NF` (base-b Goodstein coding,
    sparse) + tower material in `Hardy.lean` (`tower i`, `fastGrowingε₀`, A4 `fastGrowing_lt_fastGrowingε₀`).
- ✅ **Don't reuse `toOrdinal 2 n`/`seqONote`** — correct, and worse than "sparse": `toOrdinal b ·` is
  strictly monotone, so the pullback has `rk lt n = n` and `orderType = ⨆ succ n = ω`, NOT ε₀. F needs a
  **bijective ℕ↔NONote** coding (order type of the *whole* system), not a monotone enumeration.

### F's real blind spot — E pins the order (co-design E and F)
The `≺` whose order type F proves `=ε₀` MUST be the **same** `≺` for which PA proves `TI_≺(X)` from
Goodstein in E. Pick an arbitrary clean NONote-coding for a tidy order-type proof → you then owe E
(*PA ⊢ Goodstein → PA ⊢ TI along that coding*). The repo's natural Goodstein descent (`Domination.seqONote`,
`repr_seqONote`, `seqONote_lt`) is tailored to E but has order type ω (wrong for F). **Crux = one order
simultaneously (a) honestly ε₀ in order type [F], (b) X-free-definable [F2/F3], (c) PA-provably-TI-from-
Goodstein [E].** Co-design, or make `EpsilonOrder` expose the E-hook (standard CNF order on ℕ-codes +
Goodstein-descent-embeds-into-it).

### Corrected F work order
1. ✅ **DONE (lap 18, `src/GoodsteinPA/EpsilonOrder.lean`, all axiom-clean).** The whole **definability
   half** of F is built: `eval_lMap_structLX`, `hprec_of_eval`, `hprec_of_lMap_defined` (discharge the
   exact Boundedness `hprec` for ANY `lMap`-definable `lt`); `xpos_lMap` + `hprecXPos_lMap` (⟹ `hprecXPos`
   automatic); and the **`Seam` structure** (`GoodsteinPA.EpsilonOrder.Seam`) bundling `lt`/`φ`/`hφ`/`ge`
   with methods `Seam.prec`/`hprec`/`hprecXPos`. **Only `Seam.ge : ε₀ ≤ orderType lt` is left undischarged.**
2. **`codeOfREPred₂` + spec (Foundation-side)** — NEXT tractable brick. NOTE `Semisentence ℒₒᵣ 2 =
   Semiformula ℒₒᵣ Empty 2` ⟹ need `Empty→ℕ` embedding (`Rew.emptyMap`/`Semiformula.emb`) to feed
   `Seam.φ : Semiformula ℒₒᵣ ℕ 2` / `hφ`. (Or add a `Semisentence`-flavoured `hprec_of_lMap_defined`.)
3. **ε₀-completeness `∀ o<ε₀, ∃ x:ONote, NF x ∧ repr x = o`** = `Seam.ge` (the real girder; mathlib-only;
   Aristotle-eligible). mathlib `Ordinal.lt_epsilon_zero : o<ε₀ ↔ ∃ n, o<(ω^·)^[n] 0` is the tower hook.
4. Bijective ℕ↔NONote coding + transfer order type (build `Seam.lt` + its `ge`).
5. Instantiate `Seam` (combine 2+3+4). The definability fields are already discharged by step 1.
6. Reconcile with E (same `lt`) before claiming the seam closes the headline.

## ⏭️ LAP-16 (2026-06-22) — C₂ structural port LANDED; the `exs` wall = a calculus retrofit. Read FIRST.

**Landed (green, committed):** `src/GoodsteinPA/EmbeddingX.lean` — `embedC_LX_gen` (9/10 `Derivation2`
cases, `axm`-abstracted) + `provable_true_x` (X-free ω-completeness, `XFreeAx`-safe) + `XFreeForm`.

**THE finding (corrects the lap-15 "mechanical" claim):** the `exs` case is NOT mechanical. Collapsing
a closed witness to a numeral needs a **value-congruent EM**; for an X-atom body that requires Buchholz's
**value-congruent X-pair axiom** `{Xs,¬Xt}` (`sᴺ=tᴺ`, `AX(Z∞)`, lecture notes p.27), which our same-atom
`Deriv.axL` does NOT provide. **Read `ANALYSIS-2026-06-22-lap16-exs-axLv.md`** — full obligation map +
retrofit recon (5/8 ZinftyGen sites mechanical; `atomCutAux` = Buchholz Remark p.27 = the one hard spot;
`removeFalseLit_x` X-free-restriction keeps `XFreeAx` safe; Boundedness case 1.2 = p.29).

### LANDED (lap 16): the `axLv` retrofit — green across all 3 files, 1 disclosed `sorry` left
`Deriv.axLv` (value-congruent literal axiom, Buchholz `AX(Z∞)` p.27) threaded through ZinftyGen
(incl. `atomCutAux` Remark p.27 + 3-case `removeFalseLitAux`), Boundedness (case 1.2 p.29), and
XFreeCutElim (7/8 `_x` sites). Remaining `sorry`: `PXFc.atomCutAux`'s value-cong **X-atom-cut** case
(`XFreeCutElim.lean:1048`) — C₁/D carry it temporarily.

### NEXT (lap 17): `nrel_value_subst` clears it; then `exs`; then `embedC_LX`
1. **`PXFc.nrel_value_subst`** — `Δ` cut-free `XFreeAx`, `nrel r v ∈ Δ`, `|v|=|w|` ⟹
   `PXFc d.o 0 (insert (nrel r w) (Δ.erase (nrel r v)))`. Mirror `removeFalseLitAux_x` with frame
   `Γ.erase Lit → insert Lit' (Γ.erase Lit)`; leaves close via `PXFc.axLv`/X-free `axTrue`; matched
   `axLv` leaf: extract via `congrArg (∼·)` not raw dependent `injection`. Then transport `hNC` in
   `atomCut_x` Case `hrel`.
   - **fallback** if the dependent leaf cases swamp: isolate as a disclosed `axiom` (NOT on headline)
     to let `cutElim` go clean-modulo-that, OR keep the current `sorry` and move to `exs`/`embedC_LX`
     (which don't depend on `nrel_value_subst`) to make orthogonal progress.
2. ~~`exs`~~ ✅ DONE lap 16 — `embedC_LX_gen` is sorry-free + axiom-clean (`provable_em_cong_gen_x`
   via `axLv` + `PXFc.exI_closed`).
3. **`embedC_LX`** = `embedC_LX_gen` at `↑paLX` + `hax` (X-free `provable_true_x`, X-ind `metaInduction`).
   Independent of `nrel_value_subst` (only the cutElim end of D needs that).

### C₂-axm discharge (after structural is sorry-free) — `paLX` + `hax`
`paLX := Theory.lMap (ORing.embedding LX) 𝗣𝗔⁻ + InductionScheme LX Set.univ`. X-free axioms via
`provable_true_x`; X-induction via `metaInduction` glue. (`InductionScheme L` IS generic over ORing `L`.)

---

## ⏭️ LAP-15 (2026-06-22) — review validated lap-14 design; EXECUTE C₁ then C₂. Read this FIRST.

**Direction CONFIRMED sound** (fresh-mind review). Lap 14 finished the crux (Boundedness Thm 5.4 +
corollary B, axiom-clean). The remaining work to **Thm 5.6 (`PA ⊬ TI(ε₀)`)** is C₁+C₂ (connective
tissue), then E (Goodstein⟹TI bridge) + F (arithmetization seam). **Key validated fact (lap 15):** the
cr=0 design is feasible — `atomCut` on an X-atom, applied to `XFreeAx` inputs, preserves `XFreeAx`, because
(i) our `Provable.axL` is the *same-atom* EM axiom `{Xs,¬Xs}` so X-atomic cuts close by **set idempotence**
(the `axL` branch of `atomCutAux`, no truth), and (ii) the truth-surgery branch (`removeFalseLitAux`) fires
only on an `axTrue` leaf *equal to the cut atom* = an X-`axTrue` leaf, which `XFreeAx` forbids ⟹ **vacuous**.
So `removeFalseLitAux` is only ever invoked on X-FREE cut atoms (emitting X-free `axTrue`, fine).

### ✅ C₁ — XFreeAx-preserving cutElim → cr=0 — **DONE lap 15, axiom-clean** (`src/GoodsteinPA/XFreeCutElim.lean`).
Full `PXFc` port: builders + inversions-at-cr≤c + cut reductions + truth layer + `cutElim` + the Thm-5.6
tail `orderType_le_of_TIprovable` (`PXFc α c {TI} ⟹ ‖≺‖ ≤ 2^(ω_c^α)`). **C₂ is now the only connective
gap to Thm 5.6.** (Original C₁ plan kept below for reference.)

### C₂ — `embedC` over LX. **CRUX DONE lap 15; structural port is THE NEXT TARGET (lap 16).**
Done lap 15 (`src/GoodsteinPA/XFreeCutElim.lean`, axiom-clean): `provable_em_x` (LX excluded middle →
`PXFc`, `XFreeAx`-automatic) + **`metaInduction`** (the X-induction embedding via a cut-tower on `ψ(i)`,
`XFreeAx`-preserving — the faithfulness-critical case). **Remaining = the STRUCTURAL `embedC` port:**
mirror `src/Embedding.lean:525–660` (induct on `Derivation2 (𝗣𝗔(LX):Schema) Γ`, emit `PXFc`), swapping
`ZinftyF`/`ℒₒᵣ` → `ZinftyGen`/`LX`. `axm`: PA⁻(LX) via `provable_true_x` (port `provable_true`, X-free
`axTrue`); X-induction via `metaInduction` (+ Foundation-DSL to build `step` from `ψ` + strip
`univCl`/`🡒`). `exs`: port `exI_closed`. **First resolve: what is `Z ⊢ TI(X)` in Lean?** (the target
schema is entangled with F — check Foundation's `PeanoMinus`/`InductionScheme` genericity over `ORing`).
See HANDOFF §"NEXT (lap 16)" for the full breakdown.

### C₁ original plan (reference; superseded by the DONE above):
Introduce in `Boundedness.lean` (or a new `src/GoodsteinPA/XFreeCutElim.lean`) the cut-rank-carrying carrier
`PXFc α c Γ := ∃ d : Deriv Γ, d.o ≤ α ∧ d.cr ≤ c ∧ XFreeAx d` (generalises lap-14's `PXF` = `PXFc α 0`).
Port, each tracking `XFreeAx` (the `Deriv` constructors used are exactly axL / X-free-axTrue / verumR / weak
/ andI / orI / allω / exI / cut — none add an X-`axTrue` except the vacuous `removeFalseLit` branch above):
1. **Smart builders** `PXFc.{mono,weakening,axL,axTrue(Xfree),verumR,andI,orI,exI,allω,cut,contr}` —
   mirror `ZinftyGen.Provable.*` (lines 179–265) but carry the third `XFreeAx` component. Most are trivial
   (`XFreeAx` of a built node = conjunction/∀ of the parts' `XFreeAx`, by the `def XFreeAx` clauses).
2. **`removeFalseLitAux` / `removeFalsumAux`** preserve `XFreeAx`: port `ZinftyGen` 1087/1334 threading the
   property. KEY: `removeFalseLitAux` is stated for a FALSE literal `signedLit b₀ r₀ v₀`; on the X-route it
   is only ever called with `r₀` X-FREE (from the vacuous-branch argument), so its emitted `axTrue` leaves
   are X-free ⟹ `XFreeAx`. State it with an added hyp `Sum.isLeft r₀ = true` (X-free cut atom) to make this
   explicit, OR thread `XFreeAx d` and show the X-axTrue case can't arise.
3. **`atomCutAux` / `atomCut`** (ZinftyGen 1191/1320) preserve `XFreeAx`: the `axTrue`/`heq` branch needs the
   leaf = cut atom; for X-free cut atoms it's an X-free leaf (fine); the cut atom is X-free anyway on the
   route. To be safe handle generic atoms: if the cut atom is an X-atom, the `axTrue`/heq branch is vacuous
   by `XFreeAx`, and the `axL` branch + structural cases are truth-free.
4. **`cutReduceConj/Disj/AllAux/All`** (ZinftyGen 796/826/862/1017) preserve `XFreeAx`: they compose the
   `XFreeAx`-preserving inversions (lap-14 `andInv_xfree`/`orInv_xfree`/`allInv_xfree` — already built! but
   at cr=0; **generalise them to cr ≤ c** since inversions don't change cut rank) + builders + `cut`.
5. **`cutElimPrincipal` / `cutElimStepAux` / `cutElimStep` / `cutElim`** (1422/1479/1529/1537): structural
   port; `cutElim : PXFc α c Γ → PXFc (omegaTower c α) 0 Γ`. This is the deliverable feeding corollary B.
**Aristotle target:** a self-contained "`removeFalseLitAux` preserves `XFreeAx` for X-free `r₀`" or a
`PXFc` builder lemma (inline the `Deriv`/`XFreeAx`/`o`/`cr` defs). Bounded + mechanical.

### C₂ — `embedC` over generic LX (parallel/after C₁). Plan in lap-14 HANDOFF §C₂ (CRITICAL: X-induction
axioms via the meta-induction tower of `cut`s on `φ(i)` + `provable_em` base/step — NOT `provable_true`,
which would lone-X-`axTrue`. `𝗣𝗔⁻` X-free axioms can still go via `provable_true`. Port the lap-10 worked
meta-induction). Produces the `XFreeAx` derivation of `{TI}` that C₁ then reduces to cr=0.

## ⏭️ LAP-13 (2026-06-22) — Buchholz route EXECUTING; read this FIRST

**Read `ANALYSIS-2026-06-22-lap13-boundedness-design.md`** (full Buchholz §5 pp.26–31 read + the design).
Lap 13 built ALL the Boundedness prerequisites — green, axiom-clean, in `src/`:
- `LangX.lean` — `structLX (S:ℕ→Prop) : Structure LX ℕ` (the `⊨^S` carrier) + DecidableEq instances +
  `eval_Xatom`. **The `⊨^α` carrier.**
- `ZinftyGen.lean` — **M5 cut-elim generalised over `{L}[ORing L][Structure L ℕ][DecEq…]`**,
  `Provable.cutElim` axiom-clean. Reused wholesale (no cut-elim re-proof on the X-route).
- `TruthSem.lean` — `rk`/`orderType`/`levelSet`/`models (⊨^γ)`/`Sat` + **`models_lMap` (X-free
  invariance)** + `orderType_le_of_forall`.
- `XPositive.lean` — `XPos` + **`models_mono` (⊨^γ monotone in γ on X-positive formulas)** (Buchholz
  cases 2/3/4) + `val_structLX_eq` + `eval_mono`.
- `wip/BoundednessProbe.lean` — `Xatom_axiom`: the Buchholz X-atom axiom `{Xs,¬Xt}` (sᴺ=tᴺ) is
  derivable in generic Z∞ at `(LX,structLX S)` for ANY S. (Validation probe; stays in wip.)

**THE crux still open = Boundedness Thm 5.4 (the 8-case induction) + its formula scaffolding.** Next:
1. **Construct `Prog_≺(X)` / `TI_≺(X)` as `LX`-formulas.** Parametrise by `prec : Semiformula LX ℕ 2`
   (the order, with its ℕ-interpretation = the wellfounded `lt`; for the app `prec` is ℒₒᵣ-definable OT
   order). `Prog := ∀x(∀y(y≺x → Xy) → Xx)`, `¬Prog ≃ ∃x(∀y≺x Xy ∧ ¬Xx)`. Use Foundation DSL/`∀⁰`/`∃⁰`
   + `Xatom`. Pin the inversion shape (`exI`/`allω`/`orI` on `¬Prog`) the induction needs.
2. **Boundedness (Thm 5.4):** induction on the cut-free `Provable β 0` `Deriv` over `LX` (cases =
   our constructors axL/axTrue/verumR/weak/andI/orI/allω/exI/cut ↔ Buchholz's 8). Ingredients ALL
   built: Ax→`Xatom_axiom` (X-pair) / `models_lMap` (TRUE₀); ⋀/⋁/Rep→IH + `models_mono`; ¬Prog `exI`
   inversion = case 2; `cut` on X-atom = case 8. Conclude `Sat lt (α+2^β) Γ`. THE new theorem.
3. **Corollary** `‖≺‖ ≤ 2^β` via `orderType_le_of_forall` (invert TI → ⊢^β_1 ¬Prog,Xn → 5.4 → ⊨^{2^β}Xn
   → rk n < 2^β ∀n).
4. **M4 `embedC` over LX** (mechanical `{L}` generalisation like M5; PA(X) axioms true in structLX S
   for any S since first-order induction holds for any fixed predicate) + assemble **Thm 5.6**
   (`Z⊢TI(X) ⟹ ‖≺‖<ε₀`).
5. **Goodstein⟹TI_≺(X)** bridge (VERIFY-(b)) + arithmetization seam (OT↔ε₀, `‖≺‖=ε₀`) ⟹ headline.

**Banked off-path (do NOT resume):** witness-bounded `wip/` calculi (Towsner/operator-H). The ℒₒᵣ-only
`src/Zinfty.lean`/`src/Embedding.lean` stay for now (existing users); the live chain uses the LX versions.

## ⏭️ LAP-12 PIVOT (2026-06-22) — superseded by lap-13 above (kept for the Buchholz-route rationale)

**Read `ANALYSIS-2026-06-22-lap12-buchholz-pivot.md`.** The lap-11 "build the witness-bounded `Zᵏ`" plan
below is **retired**: lap 12 proved its §19.6 cut-elim needs the Buchholz operator `H` (ADDENDUM 7 in
`ANALYSIS-…-cutelim-k-threading.md`) — a multi-lap wall — while Buchholz §5's **witness-FREE** route reuses
the done-and-axiom-clean **M4 `embedC`** + **M5 `cutElim`** and needs only a **Boundedness** theorem. The
lap-11 "embedC is the wrong object" verdict was a conflation of order-type-boundedness (valid, Buchholz
Thm 5.4) with witness-boundedness (walled, Towsner). **`embedC` is the RIGHT object** (Buchholz Thm 5.5).

**New critical path (Buchholz §5 — `Z ⊢ TI_≺(X) ⟹ ‖≺‖ < ε₀`, then Goodstein⟹TI(ε₀)):**
- **0. VERIFY-FIRST (do before deep work):** (a) M5/M4 take the set variable `X` (extend `ℒₒᵣ`→`ℒₒᵣ∪{X}`
  or add `X` as a fixed relation symbol; `embedC.axm`/`provable_true` only need the `X`-free PA axioms);
  (b) the Goodstein⟹TI_≺(X) bridge is provable in PA via the Phase-0 CNF-ε₀ encoding. Neither is a known
  wall; confirm before sinking laps.
- **1.** Truth semantics `⊨^α Γ` (`X := {n : |n|_≺<α}`), `Prog_≺`, ≺-norm `|n|_≺`, order type `‖≺‖`,
  X-positivity — light self-contained defs.
- **2.** **Boundedness (Thm 5.4)** — `Z∞ ⊢^β_1 ¬Prog_≺(X),¬Xs₁,…,¬Xsₖ,Γ & |sᵢ|_≺≤α ⟹ ⊨^{α+2^β} Γ`
  (Γ X-positive), by induction on the cut-free `Provable β 0`-derivation (8 cases, Buchholz p.29).
  Corollary: `Z∞ ⊢^β_1 TI_≺(X) ⟹ ‖≺‖ ≤ 2^β`. THE new theorem; no Hardy, no witness bound.
- **3.** Goodstein ⟹ TI_≺(X) for the ε₀-order (bridge; Kirby–Paris/Cichoń; reuse Phase-0 encoding).
- **4.** Assembly: PA⊢Goodstein ⟹ (M4) ⟹ (M5 cut-free `β<ε₀`) ⟹ (Boundedness) `‖≺‖≤2^β<ε₀`, but the
  ε₀-order has `‖≺‖=ε₀` ⟹ `False` ⟹ discharge headline, `#print axioms` clean.

**Banked off-path (do NOT resume on this route):** the witness-bounded `wip/` calculi. Lap-12 PROVED the
norm-budget half of Towsner §19.6 (`cutReduceAllAux` in `wip/OperatorZinfty.lean`, axiom-clean, via the
norm-carrying `ZekdProv` wrapper — see ADDENDUM 6); the witness-budget half needs operator `H` (ADDENDUM
7). Kept as reference IF the Buchholz route ever stalls. M6 (Hardy) is off-path too.

---

## ⏭️ LAP-11 FINAL STATE (2026-06-22) — SUPERSEDED by the lap-12 pivot above (kept for history)

**M4 — the embedding `embedC` — is COMPLETE, axiom-clean, promoted to `src/GoodsteinPA/Embedding.lean`,
in the default build.** `embedC : Derivation2 (𝗣𝗔:Schema) Γ → ∃ c, ∀ e, ∃ α, Provable α c (Γ.image
(asg e ▹))`. The two hard cases fell to two reusable lemmas: `Provable.exI_closed` (closed-witness
∃-intro, from value-congruent EM `provable_em_cong_gen` + cut) for `exs`; `provable_true`
(ω-completeness) for `axm`. See HANDOFF lap-11.

**⚠️ COURSE CORRECTION (lap 11, grounded in Towsner §13–17) — read
`ANALYSIS-2026-06-22-witness-bound-gap.md`.** The headline needs the **witness-bounded calculus
`Zᵏ`**, NOT a bound on M5's `Provable`. M5 tracks cut-rank `c` but drops Towsner's I∃ witness bound
`k` (`value(t) ≤ h_α(k)`) — and without it the lower bound (Thm 17.1) does not bite (`provable_true`
gives a cut-free `< ε₀` derivation of `{↑gs}`; bounded quantifiers cost `allω`=`ω`, `exI` costs `+1`
regardless of witness value). So `embedC` = the *unbounded* embedding (Towsner Thm 14.2), reusable but
not the headline object; the lap-11 `wip/Bounding.lean` bridge `cutfree_lt_eps0_absurd` is FALSE as
stated. The lap-9 "bound directly on unbounded `Deriv`" reframe is retracted.

**Corrected critical path (= lap-5 plan steps 1–4, now confirmed):**
1. **`Zᵏ`** = M5 `Deriv` + `(α,k)` witness bound on `exI`. Revive banked `wip/` Zekd/OperatorZinfty
   (lap-8 worked §19.2–19.5 + control axis). Carrier: `ZekdProv` wrapper `∃ α'≤α, α'.NF ∧ Zᵏ …`.
2. **Bounded embedding (Towsner Thm 16.1/16.5/16.7)** into `Zᵏ`. `axm`: 16.1 (universal axioms, via
   `provable_true` on the bounded matrix) + 16.5 (induction, bounded meta-induction ordinal
   `ω·4#2^{rk}#2`, via `provable_em` + `Provable.exI_closed`). Structural: port `embedC` cases.
3. **`(α,k)`-cut-elim (Thm 19.9)** — `wip/` Zekd §19 grind (`ANALYSIS-…-cutelim-k-threading.md`).
4. **Subformula bridge to `B`** (M6) + Σ₁-arithmetization seam (M7a: `codeOfREPred` ↔ `atomTrue`,
   anchor `codeOfREPred_spec`) + ONote↔Ordinal<ε₀ seam ⟹ contradiction with
   `lowerBound_hardy_selfcontained`.

**BANKED reusable (src/Embedding.lean, axiom-clean):** `provable_true`, `provable_em`,
`provable_em_cong_gen`, `Provable.exI_closed`, `embedC` structural cases. Do NOT discard.
**Aristotle candidates:** a `Zᵏ` mono/inversion lemma; the ONote↔Ordinal<ε₀ bridge; a `norm_add_le`/
NF ordinal fact from the §19 bookkeeping.

---

## ⏭️ LAP-10 FINAL STATE (2026-06-22) — superseded by lap-11 above; kept for context

**Headline result: the M5 `axTrue` truth-layer surgery is DONE (axiom-clean) and the assignment-
carrying embedding `embedC` is 8/10.** Full status in `HANDOFF.md`. The TWO remaining `embedC` cases
(`axm`, `exs`) both reduce to ONE shared deep lemma — build it next:

**`provable_subst_congr` (closed-term substitution congruence — THE next chip).** For closed terms
`s s'` of equal ℕ-value and any `ψ : SyntacticSemiformula ℒₒᵣ 1`: the sequent `{∼(ψ/[s]), ψ/[s']}` is
Z∞-derivable (`∃ a, Provable a 0 {...}`). Proof = induction on `ψ.complexity` (the `provable_em`
template), tracking the two terms:
- **atomic** `ψ = rel/nrel R v` (v mentions `#0`): `ψ/[s]` and `ψ/[s']` have EQUAL truth (`Evalm`
  depends on a term only via its value — `Semiterm.val_substs` (Semantics.lean:123) + `eval_substs`
  (l.391)). So `∼(ψ/[s])` and `ψ/[s']` can't both be false ⟹ one is a true literal ⟹ `Provable.axTrue`.
  (Needs the value-equality `hval` and that `(ψ/[s]).LitTrue ↔ (ψ/[s']).LitTrue`.)
- **and/or/all/exs**: recurse structurally, exactly mirroring `provable_em`'s compound cases (the ∀/∃
  cases use the `nm`-family + `exI`/`allω`, with the substituted term threaded through `/[·]`).
Then derive:
- **`Provable.exI_closed (s closed, value m)`: `Provable α c (insert (ψ/[s]) Γ) → ∃ β, Provable β c
  (insert (∃⁰ψ) Γ)`** — cut `provable_subst_congr s (nm m)` (weakened into Γ) against the hypothesis to
  swap `ψ/[s] ⤳ ψ/[nm m]`, then `Provable.exI ψ m`. Finishes `embedC.exs` (the `rew_subst_term` setup
  is already in place — see `wip/Embedding.lean`).
- **`embedC.axm`**: `𝗣𝗔⁻` instances → strip `∀` (`allω`), decompose connectives, bottom at `axTrue`;
  `univCl(succInd ψ)` → the worked meta-induction below, with `nm n+1 = nm(n+1)` via the same congruence.

API notes: term value = `Semiterm.valm ℕ ![] id s`; numeral value `valm ℕ … (nm m) = m` (find/derive
`val_numeral`); `nm`/`signedLit`/`LitTrue` live in `src/GoodsteinPA/Zinfty.lean` now.

---

## ⏭️ LAP-10 PROGRESS (earlier in lap)

**Done lap 10 (all committed, green):**
- `rew_subst_nm` PROVED ⟹ `provable_rew`/`ZProvable.rew` fully axiom-clean (`[propext, choice,
  Quot.sound]`). The M4 renaming enabler is DONE.
- `embed` `shift` + `all` PROVED ⟹ **8/10 cases** (only `axm`, `exs` remain). `all` is the ω-rule
  case: `provable_rew` substitutes the freed var by each `nm n` (undoing the `shift` on `Γ` via
  `rewrite_comp_shift_eq_id`), then `Provable.allω`.

**Remaining M4 cases — both deep:**

### `axm` (THE crux — Z∞-derive each PA axiom). `φ ∈ (𝗣𝗔:Schema)` = `↑σ`, `σ ∈ 𝗣𝗔⁻ ∪ InductionScheme`.
`axm` does NOT need the assignment reformulation (φ=↑σ is CLOSED). By `ZProvable.weakening` (`{↑σ} ⊆ Γ`
since `↑σ ∈ Γ`) reduces to `ZProvable {↑σ}` per axiom.
- **(a) `σ ∈ 𝗣𝗔⁻` (PeanoMinus, finite):** each a true closed ∀-sentence (semiring/order axioms). Z∞-
  derivable at finite ordinal. Bounded grind (enumerate Foundation's `PeanoMinus` axiom set).
- **(b) `σ = univCl(succInd ψ)` — induction via ω-rule. FULL PAPER PROOF WORKED OUT (lap 10):**
  `succInd ψ = ψ(0) → (∀x, ψ(x)→ψ(x+1)) → ∀x, ψ(x)`. After stripping `univCl` (iterated `allω` over the
  free-var numeral assignments) and two `orI` (Tait `A→B ≡ ∼A⋎B`), reduce to the sequent
  `S := {∼ψ(0), ∼(∀x,ψ(x)→ψ(x+1)), ∀x,ψ(x)}`. Introduce `∀x,ψ(x)` by `allω`: ∀n need `{∼ψ(0), ∼∀step, ψ(n)}`.
  **Meta-induction on n** (the heart — ω-rule absorbs PA-induction):
  - n=0: `{∼ψ(0), …, ψ(0)}` has `ψ(0)` and `∼ψ(0)` ⟹ `provable_em`. ✓
  - n→n+1: want `{∼ψ0, ∼∀step, ψ(n+1)}`. **`cut` on `ψ(n)`** (cut rank = `complexity ψ + 1`, uniform):
    - left `{∼ψ0, ∼∀step, ψ(n)}` = IH `D_n`. ✓
    - right `{∼ψ0, ∼∀step, ψ(n+1), ∼ψ(n)}`: `∼∀step = ∃y∼step(y)`; `exI` witness `n` reduces to
      `{∼ψ0, ∼step(n), ψ(n+1), ∼ψ(n)}` where `∼step(n) = ψ(n) ⋏ ∼ψ(n+1)`; `andI` splits into
      `{ψ(n),…,∼ψ(n)}` (em ✓) and `{∼ψ(n+1),…,ψ(n+1)}` (em ✓).
  Cut rank uniform `complexity ψ + 1`; ordinal O(n) per instance ⟹ `allω` gives ~ω. **Uses ONLY M5's
  existing constructors** (`provable_em`/`cut`/`exI`/`andI`/`allω`/`orI`) — no new smart constructors.
  Lean friction = Foundation-syntax wrangling: unfold `↑(univCl(succInd ψ))` `“…”`-DSL into the nested
  `⋎/∼/∀/∃` structure + the numeral substitutions `step(n)`, `ψ(x+1)`. Mechanical but intricate; multi-step.

### `exs` (needs the assignment reformulation). Open witness term `t` ⟹ naive statement can't close it.
Reformulate `embed : ∀ e:ℕ→ℕ, ZProvable (Γ.image (ρe ▹))`, `ρe := Rew.rewrite (nm∘e)`. ALSO needs a Z∞
closed-term→numeral collapse (`ρe▹t = nm m` is arithmetic, built from PeanoMinus eqns ⟹ intertwined with
`axm`(a)). Restructure re-proves the 8 done cases (mechanical, ρe distributes) — do AFTER `axm`.

---

## 🧭 LAP-9 DEEP-REFLECTION COURSE-CORRECTION (2026-06-22)
Full synthesis: `REFLECTION-2026-06-22.md`. STATUS refreshed. **The priority order below (A/B/…) is
SUPERSEDED.** New order, hardest-first = **unavoidable-first**:

1. **M4 — embedding `𝗣𝗔 ⊢ φ ⟹ Z_∞ ⊢^{α}_c {φ}` = THE next target.** The *universal bottleneck*:
   needed on Route A, two-phase Route B, AND the abandoned Zekd route — there is no headline path that
   skips it. **LAP-9 FEASIBILITY PROBE (done this lap) — the machinery EXISTS; here is the mapped path:**
   - **Foundation's finitary calculus** (`.lake/.../Foundation/FirstOrder/Basic/Calculus.lean`):
     `Derivation 𝓢 : Sequent L → Type` (List sequents), constructors
     `axm (φ∈𝓢) | axL | verum | or | and | all (φ.free :: Γ⁺) | exs t | wk | cut` — maps almost 1-1
     onto M5's `ZinftyF.Deriv`. A **Finset** variant `Derivation2` exists (`Calculus2.lean:13`, same
     constructors) + `provable_iff_derivable2 : 𝓢 ⊢ φ ↔ 𝓢 ⊢!₂! φ` (`Calculus2.lean:94`) — matches M5's
     Finset substrate (use it to skip the List→Finset bridge).
   - **The lap-6 "derivation-substitution" deep case is ALREADY PROVIDED:**
     `Derivation.rewrite : 𝓢 ⟹ Γ → ∀ (f:ℕ→SyntacticTerm L), 𝓢 ⟹ Γ.map (Rew.rewrite f ▹ ·)`
     (`Calculus.lean:255`). So the **finitary `all` (`φ.free :: Γ⁺`) → M5 ω-rule `allω`** conversion is:
     for each numeral `n`, `rewrite` the free var by `n` to get `𝓢 ⟹ φ/[n] :: Γ`, embed each, assemble
     via `Provable.allω` (`src/Zinfty.lean:183`). **No missing machinery.**
   - **The `axm` case** splits cleanly because `𝗣𝗔 = 𝗣𝗔⁻ + InductionScheme ℒₒᵣ Set.univ`
     (`Foundation/FirstOrder/Arithmetic/Schemata.lean:52`): (a) `φ ∈ 𝗣𝗔⁻` (PeanoMinus, **finite**) —
     each a true ∀-sentence, Z∞-derivable at a finite ordinal (bounded grind); (b) `φ = univCl(succInd ψ)`
     (`mem_InductionScheme_of_mem`, Schemata.lean:85) — derive in Z∞ **via the ω-rule** (`ψ(n)` for each
     `n` by `n`-fold step, then `allω`), ordinal ~`ω·k`. **This is the one genuine deep case** (Buchholz
     §5.5 / Towsner §16) — but it's standard textbook content and `Provable.allω` is already built.
   - **LAP-9 DID THIS: `wip/Embedding.lean` COMPILES** (`lake env lean wip/Embedding.lean`).
     `embed : Derivation2 (𝗣𝗔:Schema) Γ → ∃ α c, Provable α c Γ` over the SAME `Finset (SyntacticFormula
     ℒₒᵣ)` substrate (no language translation). **6/10 cases DONE** (verum/and/or/wk/cut/closed).
     **`provable_em` FULLY PROVED + axiom-clean** (`[propext,choice,Quot.sound]`): the Z∞ excluded-middle
     `∀ φ Γ, φ∈Γ → ∼φ∈Γ → ∃ a, Provable a 0 Γ`, incl. the ∀/∃ numeral ω-family. Promotable to `src/`.
   - **4 disclosed `sorry`s remain = the genuine deep content, ALL needing free-var/subst machinery
     for M5's `Deriv` (interdependent). Build the shared enabler FIRST:**
     - **(0, enabler) M5 renaming/subst lemma** = analogue of Foundation `Derivation.rewrite`
       (`Calculus.lean:255`): `Provable α c Γ → Provable α c (Γ.image (Rew…▹·))`, induction on `Deriv`
       (8 cases; `allω` case = the care point). Unlocks `shift`/`all`/`exs` together.
     - **`shift`** — corollary of the enabler. **`all`** — free var `&0` → each numeral via enabler →
       `allω`. **`exs`** — witness term → numeral value → `exI`. **`axm`** (deepest) — PeanoMinus finite +
       `univCl(succInd ψ)` via ω-rule. Buchholz §5.5.
2. **M7a — transparent arithmetization** = parallel/fallback (shovel-ready, faithfulness-gated):
   `gAllReal = ∀x∃y[g_y(x)=0]` + `𝗣𝗔 ⊢ goodsteinSentence ↔ gAllReal`, gated by `Bridge.lean`.
3. **Bounding bridge (small, downstream):** prove on M5's **real cut-free `Deriv`** directly
   (`allInv` ∀ away, read `exI` numeral off, witness `≤ hardy(toONote α)N`), combine with M6's
   `hardy_lt_goodsteinLength` (`src/LowerBound.lean:258`). **Reuse M6's ℕ-domination fact, NOT the
   abstract `B` transport** — the `B` lower bound is the template, banked. Ordinal seam = one `toONote`
   (check mathlib `ONote.repr` surjectivity onto `[0,ε₀)`).

**DO NOT RESUME** the witness-bounded cut-elim thread: `cutReduceAllAux`, `Zekd`, any 4th index
calculus. Proven off-critical-path (lap-8 findings: single-index Hardy inequality is FALSE; landscape
memory: the Hardy `k` index was never needed for cut-elim). `wip/{BoundedZinfty,SplitZinfty,
OperatorZinfty}.lean` = reference only. Everything below this block (the lap-7/8 A/B/Zekd plans) is
**historical context**, not the live plan.

---

## 🗺️ OPEN-OBLIGATION INVENTORY (lap-7 end) — full list + 3 attack paths each
### ⚠️ SUPERSEDED by the lap-9 block above — kept for history/attack-path detail only.
The headline `Statement.peano_not_proves_goodstein` is the only `src/` sorry (the designated open
target; anti-fraud — do NOT fill until the chain genuinely closes axiom-clean). It is reached via the
connecting spine. Open spine pieces, with attack paths:

## 🧭 LAP-8 STRATEGIC PIVOT (ON-LINE-FINDINGS 2026-06-22) — TWO-PHASE architecture is the headline path
The findings doc (`archive/findings/…omega-rule-commuting-bound.md`) **proves the §19.6 commuting bound
cannot close in any single-numeric-`k`/`(k,d)`/`(k,d,e)` system** (the Hardy inequality is FALSE; Towsner
hand-waves it). The lap-8 `Zekd cutReduceAllAux` commuting cases hit exactly this wall (norm-boundary
strictness). **Resolution (literature-standard, Buchholz §5 / Schwichtenberg–Wainer Ch.4): NEVER thread
the witness index through cut-elim. Two phases:**
  1. **Cut-elimination on the WITNESS-INDEX-FREE calculus** — pure ordinal + cut-rank. **This is M5,
     `src/Zinfty.lean`, ALREADY DONE + axiom-clean** (`Deriv.Provable.cutElim`). Commuting cases there are
     one-liners (`α#βₙ < α#β`) — no `k`/`d`/`e` to thread.
  2. **Hardy-bound the CUT-FREE result** — on a cut-free derivation there is NO `+α` growth, so the
     `max{k,n}`-vs-`+α` clash cannot arise. **This is M6, `lowerBound_hardy_selfcontained`, ALREADY DONE**
     (applied at `c=0`).
**The remaining work is the BRIDGE connecting them** (was "step 4 subformula bridge", now the critical
path): a cut-free `Z∞ ⊢^{α}_0 {gAll}` (from M4-embed + M5-cutElim) ⟹ a witness-bounded `B`-derivation
(subformula property: cut-free `{gAll}` uses only `GForm` subformulas; + a Hardy **bounding lemma** reading
off `∃`-witnesses ≤ `H_α(N)` on the cut-free structure) ⟹ contradicts `lowerBound_hardy_selfcontained`.
**Next lap: build this bridge.** The `Zekd`/`SplitZinfty` witness-bounded-cut-elim effort is a banked
alternative (NOT on the critical path anymore); its inversions/§19.5/`mono_e`/structural-`cutReduceAllAux`
cases stand for reference. Faithfulness corrections from the findings (carry into write-ups): Lemma 16.10
is `α<β ∧ τα<k ⟹ h_α(k)<h_β(k)` (strict); cut-elim base is `ω^α` (Towsner)/`3^α` (Buchholz), not `2^α`;
`h_{β#ω}(k)=h_β(2k)` is NOT a Towsner lemma (heuristic only); the operator `H[X]` is Buchholz-1992, not
the on-disk notes (which are pure-ordinal for PA).

---

**LAP-8 UPDATE — (A)/(B) substantially advanced.** Hardy-infra layer BANKED (axiom-clean, `src/`):
`hardy_add_comp`/`hardy_add_collapse` (control collapse) + `hardy_comp_lt_goodsteinLength` (lower-bound
nested-index domination). Control-ordinal operator calculus `Zekd α e k d c Γ` built in
`wip/OperatorZinfty.lean`, sorry-free through §19.5, with the NEW `mono_e` control axis. Design validated
(ADDENDUM 5): single control ordinal `e` closes the ADDENDUM-4 witness-index obstruction (no set-valued
`H` needed). **ONE remaining girder for step-1 cut-elim: §19.6 `cutReduceAll` on `Zekd`.**
  - **[LAP-8 NEXT] Port `Zinfty.lean:785 cutReduceAllAux` to `Zekd`.** Invert ∀-side → `fam`; induct on
    ∃-side; principal `exI` cuts `fam(witness)`; commuting cases reapply at `osucc(α+γ)`
    (`add_osucc_descent` banked), `d ↦ d + norm α` (norm-budget), `e` raised at the top cut via `mono_e`.
    **FIRST**: NF-ify the `Zekd` leaf rules (`trueRel`/`trueNrel` need `hαNF`) — leaf cases need
    `norm(α+γ) ≤ norm α + norm γ` (`norm_add_le`, NF-essential). ADDENDUM 5 has the subtlety + 3 fixes
    (option (b)/NF-ify-leaves cleanest). Budget arithmetic: issue leaf at the node's own `γ` then `weak`
    up to `osucc(α+γ)` (avoids the `osucc` `+1`-vs-strict-`<` boundary).

**(A) §19.6 `cutReduceAll` — the critical-path crux** (calculus + Hardy infra now in place — see LAP-8).
  1. **Control-ordinal operator calculus (RECOMMENDED).** Replace `Zkd`'s `(k,d)` with an index
     `(e, k, d)` where `e : ONote` is a *control ordinal* and the ω-premise / witness bound use
     `hardy e (n + k) + …` (a `hardy`-closed index). Cut-elim raises `e` to dominate cut-formula bounds;
     the principal cut's witness `w ≤ hardy γ (max k n + d) ≤ hardy e (n + k + d)` (γ<e, hardy mono in
     both args) stays controlled. Lower bound survives via **general Hardy additivity** `hardy α (hardy e m)
     ~ hardy (e (#)+ α) m` (e+α<ε₀ ⟹ G dominates). Port §19.2–19.5 from `SplitZinfty` (`max k ·` ⤳
     `hardy e ·`). **Lap-7 de-risk:** the cut-elim *control* side needs NO new lemma — the witness
     control `hardy γ (idx) ≤ hardy e (idx)` (γ<e) is the **existing** `hardy_le_of_lt` (`src/Hardy.lean`,
     `+ hardy_monotone` for the argument). Only the *lower-bound* side needs general Hardy additivity (B).
  2. **Buchholz set-valued operator `H`** (Buchholz §9 / 1992) — fully general; heavier. Fallback if the
     single control-ordinal `e` can't express some closure. `ON-LINE-REQUEST` filed for the PA spec.
  3. **Restrict the calculus to the `GForm` fragment** (the headline only needs cut-elim for derivations
     of `{gAll}` and its subformulas). The ∃-side may then have bounded structure making the witness
     index controllable without a full operator. Investigate whether the subformula property pre-bounds it.

**(B) General Hardy additivity** `hardy (e (#)+ α) m = hardy α (hardy e m)` (infra for A.1; generalizes
  the proved finite-tail `hardy_add_ofNat`).
  1. Induct on α through the fundamental-sequence structure (successor + limit), using the banked
     `fundamentalSequence`/`Reaches`/`hardy_le_of_reaches` machinery in `src/Hardy.lean`.
  2. Prove only the *inequality* `hardy α (hardy e m) ≤ hardy (e + α) m` (ordinary `+`) — weaker but may
     suffice for domination; likely easier than the exact `#`-additive identity.
  3. Aristotle target: self-contained ONote/Hardy statement (feed once A.1's exact form is pinned).

**(C) §19.7 `cutElimStep` + §19.9 `cutElim`** (depend on A). Ordinal `ω^α` (`norm_omegaPow` banked);
  iterate. Paths: port `src/Zinfty.lean` structure / the `SplitZinfty` helpers / existential-index.

**(D) Subformula bridge** (cut-free operator-derivation of `{gAll}` ⟹ `B`-derivation ⟹ lower bound).
  Paths: structural subformula-closure induction / `GForm ↪ ℒₒᵣ` identification / reuse M6 as-is.

**(E) M4 embedding `PA ⊢ φ ⟹ (calculus) ⊢ φ`** — INDEPENDENT of A (parallel thread). Recon done lap 6.
  Paths: induct on Foundation `Derivation` (axm = Lemma 16.1 + Cor 16.6 induction instances; `all`→ω-rule
  via derivation-substitution; `exs`→witness bound) / list→finset bridge / scope `axm` first.

**(F) M7a language gap** `𝗣𝗔 ⊢ goodsteinSentence ↔ gAllReal` — INDEPENDENT (parallel thread). Paths:
  arithmetize `goodsteinSeq` as a real Π₂ `ℒₒᵣ` formula (Foundation Σ₁ tools) / gate by `Bridge.lean` /
  prove one direction first.

**Lap-7 acted on (A): conceptual crux resolved, 4 lemmas proved, `(k,d)` calculus through §19.5 built,
the two §19.6 obstructions precisely characterized (norm-budget CLOSED, witness-index ⟹ needs operator).**

---

## ✅ LAP-7 — cut-elim `k`/`τ` crux RESOLVED (offline read of Towsner §15–§20). See `ANALYSIS-2026-06-22-cutelim-k-threading.md`.
The lap-6 "norm grows under addition ⟹ cut-elim might break `norm<k`" worry was a **misframing**.
Resolved facts (the design for ALL of §19): (a) `k` is **not** fixed — it grows (§19.5 `k↦2k`; §19.6
`k↦h_{β#ω}(k)`; §19.7 `k↦h_{ω^α}(k)`). (b) `lowerBound_hardy_selfcontained` is already `∀k` ⟹ growth
harmless. (c) every `ONote` is `<ε₀` by construction ⟹ ε₀ side-condition **free**. ⟹ **state the whole
cut-elim chain existentially in `k`**: `CutFree α Γ := ∃k, Zk α k 0 Γ`; endgame
`(∃k c, Zk α k c Γ) → α.NF → ∃ α' k', α'.NF ∧ Zk α' k' 0 Γ`, then subformula-bridge + lower bound.
Route decision recorded in `STATUS.md`: **STAY ROUTE B**. `ON-LINE-REQUEST` closed.

### Refined §19.6 plan (`cutReduceAll` for `Zk`) — the next girder, now unblocked
Port `src/Zinfty.lean:785 cutReduceAllAux` (the lap-3 ∀/∃ reduction over the unbounded `(α,c)`
calculus, fully proved) to `Zk`, adding the `(k,NF,norm)` bookkeeping:
- **Structure (unchanged from lap 3):** invert the ∀-side once (`allInv` → numeral family
  `fam : ∀n, Zk α k c (insert (φ/[nm n]) Γ)`), then **induct on the ∃-side `Zk γ k c Δ`** with
  `(∃∼φ)∈Δ`; principal `exI` case = cut `fam n` at the witness numeral; commuting cases re-apply the
  rule over `Δ.erase(∃∼φ) ∪ Γ`. `Zk` is `Prop`-valued, so induct directly (no height fn `o d`); the
  running ordinal is the constructor bound `γ` itself (sub-bounds `<γ` come from the descent premises).
- **Bound:** ordinal `α + γ` (`ONote.+`, `add_lt_add_left_NF`/`le_add_left_NF` banked); slack via
  `osucc` at cuts (`lt_osucc`, `osucc_NF` banked).
- **`k`-growth (the new content vs lap 3):** the conclusion's `k` is **`h_{β#ω}(k)`** (a Hardy value),
  NOT the input `k` — Towsner §19.6 exactly. ⚠️ **LAP-7 FINDING — the `allω`-commuting case is a REAL
  obstruction, not mechanical.** Reconstructing the ω-rule after adding `α` to the bound needs
  `norm(α+βₙ) < max K n`, but `norm(α+βₙ) ~ norm α + n` exceeds `max K n ~ n` for large `n`, for ANY
  fixed `K` (norm is not `<`-monotone, so `βₙ<β` doesn't bound `norm βₙ`; natural sum + `τα<k` don't
  save it). Towsner's "follows from IH" glosses this. **The numeric `(α,k)` form may genuinely need
  either (1) Buchholz operator-controlled derivations, (2) a generalized `Zk.allω` with a controlled
  premise-index `f n` (re-verify M6 lower bound survives — tension: cut-elim wants `f` to GROW to fit
  `+α`, the lower bound wants witnesses `≤ h(f n) < G(n)` BOUNDED), or (3) re-derived Towsner 16.8–16.10
  Hardy inequalities (likely insufficient per the `+α` analysis).** Full derivation +
  attack options in `ANALYSIS-2026-06-22-cutelim-k-threading.md` ADDENDUM. `ON-LINE-REQUEST` re-filed.
  ⚠️ **LAP-7 UPDATE — option (2) (global numeric index swap) is ELIMINATED.** Tried `max k n → k + n`:
  it fixes §19.6-commuting (`(k+n)+norm α = (k+norm α)+n`) but **breaks `allInv`**, whose principal case
  relies on `max`'s idempotence (`max(max k n₀)n₀ = max k n₀`); under `+` the lingering-duplicate subcase
  produces index `k + 2n₀` (slope 2), forcing the lower bound to need `hardy α (2n) < G n` — a
  *multiplicative* rescaling the additivity lemma does NOT give. So **no single numeric `idx(k,n)` serves
  both** `allInv` (wants idempotence) and §19.6-commuting (wants additive shift). Full analysis:
  `ANALYSIS-…-cutelim-k-threading.md` **ADDENDUM 2**. The `k+n` experiment was reverted (wip stays
  sorry-free). **REVISED RECOMMENDATION = option (1): function/operator-valued `allω` index** (Buchholz
  operator-controlled derivations specialized to PA): each `allω` carries a controlled index *function*
  `g : ℕ → ℕ` (`g n ≤ n + const`), rules compose `g`s (idempotently for `allInv`, post-composing `+norm α`
  for cut-elim). Keeps slope 1, so the proved domination lemmas (`hardy_add_ofNat`,
  `hardy_shift_lt_goodsteinLength`) still apply. Larger refactor of `wip/BoundedZinfty.lean` + `B`/lower
  bound, but it's the only design closing BOTH obstructions. Start fresh-headed; don't half-break wip.
  Lap-7 investigation confirmed M6 domination is STRONG (`hardy_lt_goodsteinLength {α NF} : ∃ N, ∀ m ≥ N,
  hardy α m < G m` — beats `hardy α` at *every* large `m`), so the controlled-`g` lower bound is viable.
  **This is now the hardest-first crux of step 1 — the principal `exI` case is clean; the commuting
  `allω` bounding is the live frontier.** Use `hardy` (`src/Hardy.lean`; `Reaches`/`fundamentalSequence`/
  `hardy_le_of_reaches`/`hardy_monotone` already banked).
- **`norm` ingredient (lap 7): BOTH PROVED + banked, axiom-clean** in `wip/BoundedZinfty.lean`:
  `norm_addAux_le` (head-merge bound) and `norm_add_le {α γ NF} : norm(α+γ) ≤ norm α + norm γ` (the
  `τ(α#β)≤τα+τβ` budget fact). NF is essential — the NF-free version is machine-checked FALSE; the
  eq-merge case is discharged by additive-principality **absorption** (`a + γ = γ` when `repr a <
  ω^(repr e) ≤ repr γ`, via `Ordinal.add_of_omega0_opow_le`). `wip/BoundedZinfty.lean` is **sorry-free**.

---

State after lap 6 (2026-06-22). Build green (`lake build GoodsteinPA`, 1257 jobs). Phase 0 + Phase 1
clean; **M5 (cut-elim) and M6 (Hardy lower bound) both DONE**. Headline stays a literal `sorry`
(anti-fraud). See `PHASE2-DECOMPOSITION.md` for the girder ladder; `ANALYSIS-…-bounding-resolution.md`
§"M4 scoping" for the 5-step connecting spine.

## ✅ LAP-6 — M6 DONE (lower bound self-contained); TOP PRIORITY now = step 1, the `Zᵏ` calculus
`src/GoodsteinPA/LowerBound.lean` (`lowerBound_hardy_selfcontained`) is the full Towsner Thm 17.1 with
no hypotheses beyond `α.NF`, axiom-clean modulo the 🟢 `native_decide` Goodstein base-cases. M5 + M6
are now both complete but **disconnected** (M5 = unbounded `(α,c)` over real `ℒₒᵣ`; M6 = bounded
`(α,k)` over the `GForm` fragment). The connecting spine (hardest-first):

### Step 1 — `Zᵏ`: witness-bounded ω-calculus over real `SyntacticFormula ℒₒᵣ` (Towsner §15)
**DEFINED + §19.2–19.5 DONE** (`wip/BoundedZinfty.lean`, lap 6, all axiom-clean). Chosen design:
**ONote-indexed, B-style (bound-as-parameter, no `⨆`-suprema)** over real `ℒₒᵣ` formulas, with both
`(α,k)` side conditions the lower bound needs (lap-4 finding — cannot be dropped): truth-atom rules
`trueRel`/`trueNrel` (`norm α < k`) + `∃`-witness bound (`exI` carries `n ≤ hardy α k`). Plus a
height-preserving `wk`, a β<α `weak` (raises ordinals in principal inversion cases), `∧`/`∨`/`cut`.
Built: `mono_k`, `mono_c`, `wk`/`weakening`; the **full inversion suite** `orInv`/`andInvL`/`andInvR`/
`allInv` (reshuffle helpers `invPush`/`invPull`/`invPush2`/`inv1Push`/… kept standalone so
`DecidableEq Form` doesn't blow the heartbeat limit inside the big inductions); the **§19.5** ∧/∨
cut-reductions `cutReduceConj`/`cutReduceDisj` (`lt_osucc` + caller-supplied NF upper bound `δ`, result
at `osucc δ` — no natural sum needed).

**NEXT — §19.6 ∀/∃ cut-reduction `cutReduceAllAux`** (the hard, non-invertible one; the witness-bound
survival crux). Port `src/Zinfty.lean`'s measure-style version to parameter-style:
- **Bound framing:** the family `fam : ∀ n, Zk α k c (insert (φ/[nm n]) Γ)`; induct on the ∃-side
  `d : Zk γ k c Δ` with running conclusion bound **`α + γ`** (`ONote.add`; `add_nf` instance gives NF,
  `repr_add` + `Ordinal.add_lt_add_left` give strict monotonicity in `γ` for the premise-`<` conditions).
- **Principal `exI` case** (∃-side introduces `∃⁰∼φ` at witness `n`): cut `fam n` (∀-instance) against
  the ∃-premise on `φ/[nm n]` (complexity `< c`). This is the witness cut.
- The non-principal cases mirror the inversions (reuse the union-reshuffle pattern; src frames the
  running sequent as `Δ.erase (∃⁰∼φ) ∪ Γ`).

**Then `cutElimStep` (§19.7, `c+1→c`, bound `ω^α = oadd α 1 0`) + `cutElim` (§19.9).**

⚠️ **KEY FINDING (lap 6) — the `norm<k` budget does NOT survive ordinal addition; it grows.** `norm`
is `max` over CNF coefficients (`Hardy.lean:637`), and addition MERGES coefficients when leading
exponents coincide: machine-checked `norm ω = 1` but `norm (ω+ω) = norm (ω·2) = 2`. So the naive
"`norm(α+γ) ≤ max`" is **false**; the true bound is additive (`norm(α+γ) ≤ norm α + norm γ`, to verify).
Consequences for the cut-elim design:
- **§19.7 `ω^α` blow-up is SAFE:** `norm (oadd α 1 0) = max (norm α) 1` (machine-checked, `norm_omegaPow`),
  coefficient stays `1` — a pure ω-tower never bumps `norm` beyond `max(norm α, 1)`. So iterating the
  rank-reduction keeps the budget (for `k ≥ 2`).
- **§19.6 within-rank addition is where `norm` grows.** The ω-rule combines premises by *supremum*
  (bound-as-parameter, no sum), NOT addition — so it doesn't bump `norm`. Only the §19.6 cut-combination
  (∀-family `α` + ∃-side `γ`) is an addition, and cut-elim performs finitely many such reductions (cut
  rank `c` finite), so `norm` grows by a *bounded* amount ⇒ choosing `k` large enough at embedding (M4)
  absorbs it. **The precise bookkeeping (how Towsner threads `τ`/`k` through §19; the exact growth bound)
  needs the paper — see `ON-LINE-REQUEST.md`.** Do NOT claim cut-elim closed until this is pinned down.
- Helpers banked this lap: `lt_osucc`, `add_lt_add_left_NF`, `le_add_left_NF`, `norm_omegaPow`. Still
  need (build with §19.6): `norm (α+γ) ≤ norm α + norm γ`, `norm (osucc δ) ≤ norm δ + 1`.
(`Ordinal.nadd`/`♯` absent in mathlib v4.31.0; ordinary `+`/`osucc` with slack, as `src/Zinfty.lean` did
— note natural sum would NOT help here, it merges coefficients the same way.)

### Step 2 — M4 embedding `PA ⊢ φ ⟹ Zᵏ ⊢^{α,k}_c φ`  (UNBLOCKED — independent of the §19.6 τ/k question)
α<ε₀, finite c (Towsner §16/§18). **Reconnaissance done (lap 6).** Foundation's proof object is
`Derivation (𝓢 : Schema L) : Sequent L → Type` in `Foundation/FirstOrder/Basic/Calculus.lean:20`
(`Sequent L = List (SyntacticFormula L)`, one-sided/Tait). Constructors + their `Zᵏ` image (the
embedding inducts on this `Derivation`):
- `axm : φ ∈ 𝓢` — **the PA-axiom case, the crux.** `Zᵏ` must derive each PA axiom at a bounded `(α,k)`:
  Lemma 16.1 (true Δ₀/atomic axioms via the `trueRel`/`trueNrel` rules, low bound) + Cor 16.6 (the
  **induction-scheme** instances at bound `ω·4 # 2rk(φ) # 8` — the real work; `∀`-closure via the
  ω-rule). This is the bulk of M4.
- `axL r v`→`Zk.axL`; `verum`→`Zk.verumR`; `or`→`Zk.orI`; `and`→`Zk.andI`; `wk`→`Zk.wk`;
  `cut`→`Zk.cut` (finitely many cut formulas of bounded complexity ⇒ finite cut rank `c`).
- `all` (eigenvariable `φ.free`) → **`Zk.allω`** (finitary ∀ becomes the ω-rule: derive `φ/[nm n]` for
  every `n`). 2nd deep case: needs **derivation-substitution** — specialize the single eigenvariable
  premise (`φ.free :: Γ⁺`, fresh free var) to each numeral `n` (Foundation `Rew`/free-var substitution
  on a whole `Derivation`). The uniform eigenvariable proof instantiates to all `ℕ`-many ω-rule premises.
- `exs t` (witness *term* `t`) → **`Zk.exI`** with numeral `⟦t⟧ℕ`, needing the **witness bound**
  `⟦t⟧ℕ ≤ hardy α k` (Towsner picks `k` large enough — where the bound is established).
Two wrinkles: (a) Foundation sequents are **`List`**, `Zᵏ` uses **`Finset`** — need a list→finset bridge.
(b) Confirm how `𝗣𝗔 ⊢ ↑goodsteinSentence` (the headline's `LO.Entailment`) connects to `Derivation
𝗣𝗔-schema` (the `OneSided` instance at `Calculus.lean:31` is `Derivation`). The structural map is
clean — the depth is all in `axm`. Foundation-heavy; not Aristotle-friendly.

### Step 3 — cut-elim with `k`
Redo `src/Zinfty.lean` §19 tracking the witness bound. The inversions/reductions *strategy* ports; the
new content is threading `h_{ω^α}(k)` through §19.6 (∀/∃ reduction) and confirming `ω^α < ε₀` keeps the
final cut-free bound `< ε₀` (so domination still bites). No deep math doubt (literature-standard,
host-verified) — formalization labor.

### Step 4 — subformula bridge (the clean small connector)
A cut-free `Zᵏ`-derivation of `{gAll}` contains only subformulas of `gAll` closed under numeral
substitution = exactly `{gAll, gEx n, atom m n}` = the `GForm` fragment, so it **is** a `B`-derivation
⇒ `lowerBound_hardy_selfcontained` refutes it. Needs: a subformula-closure lemma for the ω-calculus
(structural induction over `Deriv`, ω-rule = closure under numeral substitution) + the `GForm ↪ ℒₒᵣ`
encoding identification. Reuses M6 as-is.

### M7a — the language gap (the other hard girder; Towsner Remark 10.3)
`goodsteinSentence = ∀⁰ (codeOfREPred goodsteinTerminates)` is an **opaque Σ₁ blob**, NOT the
transparent `∀x∃y g_y(x)=0` that step 4 needs. Build a transparent Π₂ `gAllReal` (arithmetize
`goodsteinSeq` as a real `ℒₒᵣ` formula — Foundation's Σ₁/representability tools) and prove
`𝗣𝗔 ⊢ goodsteinSentence ↔ gAllReal`, gated by `Bridge.lean`'s spec so faithfulness can't regress.
Then the subformula bridge runs on `gAllReal`.

## ✅ LAP-5 — O0 done + the I∀ frontier RESOLVED; TOP PRIORITY is now O0′ (port `Hdom`)
The witness-bounded calculus `B` is now built over `ONote` with the **concrete** Hardy hierarchy
(`src/GoodsteinPA/Hardy.lean`, ported from Track-1). `wip/LowerBoundHardy.lean` proves, axiom-clean:
the ∃-fragment lower bound (`lowerBound_existential_hardy`, zero abstract hyps), `k`-monotonicity,
**∀-inversion** (`B.allInv`), and the **full Thm 17.1 modulo domination** (`lowerBound_hardy`). The
lap-4 "accumulating existentials" wall is resolved by inverting `gAll` away rather than carrying it
(see `ANALYSIS-2026-06-22-bounding-resolution.md`).

### O0′ (TOP) — discharge `Hdom : ∃ x, hardy α (max k x) < G x`
`G = goodsteinLength`; Goodstein defs (`bump`/`base`/`goodsteinSeq`) are **byte-identical** to Track-1.
Port `~/src/lean-formalizations Logic/Goodstein/{Length,Domination,DominationOmega,TowerDomination,
GrowthStatement,DominationCorollary,GoodsteinLike,DominationBaseCases}.lean` →
`goodsteinLength_dominates_fastGrowing {o}(ho:o.NF) : ∃ N, ∀ m≥N, fastGrowing o m ≤ goodsteinLength m+2`.
Chain `hardy α m ≤ fastGrowing α m` (`hardy_le_fastGrowing`) + identify `G = goodsteinLength`. **Bridge
the `+2` to strict `<`** (the one genuinely-open bit; fastGrowing's gap over hardy swallows +2 for
large m — good Aristotle target). Then `lowerBound_hardy` becomes a self-contained Thm 17.1. NB the
port carries documented `native_decide` finite-base-case axioms.

<details><summary>Superseded lap-4 O0 (re-architect on the witness-bounded calculus) — DONE</summary>

## ⚠️ TOP PRIORITY (lap 4) — O0: re-architect on the witness-bounded calculus
**Finding (machine-checked, axiom-clean, `wip/WitnessBound.lean`):** the completed M5 cut-elimination
in `src/Zinfty.lean` is for a calculus with an **unbounded `∃`-witness** and **no numeric index `k`**.
That calculus cannot reach the headline — `unbounded_proves_goodstein` derives the Goodstein sentence
cut-free at ordinal 2, so Towsner's lower bound (17.1) is FALSE for it. The headline needs the
**witness-bounded, Hardy-indexed `(α,k)` calculus** (Towsner §15), where `∃` carries `v ≤ h α k`,
`True` carries `τ α < k`, and `∀`'s premises use `max k n`. See `STATUS.md` lap-4 finding.

Attack paths (hardest-first; the crux is now the lower bound + the `k`-tracking cut-elim):
1. **Finish the lower bound (M6 / Thm 17.1).** `wip/WitnessBound.lean` has the calculus `B` and the
   `∀`-free fragment proved (`lowerBound_existential`). The remaining frontier is the `gAll`/`I∀`
   case with *accumulating* existentials — Towsner's stated invariant looks insufficient there
   (see `ON-LINE-REQUEST.md`). Either crack the refined invariant (likely a single-ordinal
   `H`-controlled measure, Buchholz style) or get it from the literature, then discharge the abstract
   Hardy hypotheses `Hmono`/`Hdom`/`HG` from a real `h_α`/`τ`/`G` (mathlib `ONote.fastGrowing`?).
2. **Retrofit `k` into cut-elimination.** Redo `src/Zinfty.lean`'s inversions/reductions tracking the
   numeric bound `k` (the *strategy* ports; only the bookkeeping changes). Needed so the cut-free
   output of M5 still carries the `(α,k)` bound that 17.1 refutes.
3. **Decide architecture:** Towsner two-index `(α,k)` vs. Buchholz single-ordinal `H`-controlled
   derivations. The latter may formalize more cleanly (one well-founded measure, standard boundedness
   theorem). Resolve via `ON-LINE-REQUEST.md` before sinking the cut-elim redo.

Plus the **PA↔PA⁺ language gap**: our headline is real-`ℒₒᵣ` PA with an opaque Σ₁ `goodsteinSentence`,
not Towsner's extended-language `∀x∃y g_y(x)=0`; the arithmetization bridge Towsner skips (Remark
10.3) is a separate deep girder (M7-adjacent). Route A (via `Con(PA)`, O1) stays entirely in real PA
and sidesteps this — re-evaluate Route A vs Route B in light of the language gap.
</details>

## Open obligations (toward a clean headline)

### O1 — `Reduction.goodstein_implies_consistency` (Route A girder) — `sorry`
`𝗣𝗔 ⊢ γ → 𝗣𝗔 ⊢ Con(𝗣𝗔)`. The deep ordinal-analysis content via Con(PA).
Attack paths:
1. **Gentzen `TI(ε₀) ⊢ Con(𝗣𝗔)` + `γ ⟹ TI(ε₀)`** — the classic route; needs `PA_∞`
   cut-elimination (same `Z_∞` machinery as Route B) plus the Con(PA) lower bound. Reuses
   Foundation's Gödel II downstream. (Buchholz `on-gentzens-first-consistency-proof`.)
2. **Drop Route A entirely for Route B** (recommended) — Towsner shows `𝗣𝗔 ⊬ γ` directly without
   Con(PA); then `goodstein_implies_consistency` becomes unnecessary (leave it as a documented,
   never-used alternative). The headline is discharged via O2's chain instead.
3. Partial: keep the lemma but prove the *easier* converse direction / a weaker reflection
   principle first as warmup, to exercise Foundation's provability API (`⊢`, `Con`, D1–D3).

### O2 — the Phase-2 girder (Route B, Towsner) — milestones M3…M7 in `PHASE2-DECOMPOSITION.md`

**✅ M3 (Z_∞ calculus) + M5 (cut-elimination) COMPLETE & axiom-clean** in
`src/GoodsteinPA/Zinfty.lean` (promoted from `wip/`, 0 sorries, `#print axioms` = trust base only,
2026-06-22 lap 3). The whole Towsner §19 is machine-checked: inversions 19.2–19.4, cut reductions
19.5 (`cutReduceConj/Disj`) + 19.6 (`cutReduceAll`), atomic/⊥ cuts (`atomCut`/`removeFalsum`, **no
truth layer needed** — set sequents dissolve them), `cutElimStep` (19.7), `cutElim` (19.9). Key
findings: `Ordinal.nadd` ABSENT in mathlib v4.31.0 → ordinary `+` with `+1` slack (bounded below
`ω^(·+1)` by additive principality); the Hardy `k` index was NOT needed for cut-elim (pure Schütte
`(α,c)` suffices — it's a §17 device); `exI` restricted to numeral witnesses.

**NEXT (hardest-first): M4 — the embedding `PA⁺ ↪ Z_∞`** (Towsner §16 Thm 16.7 / §18 Thm 18.1). A
`PA⁺` proof of `φ` yields `∃ α<ε₀, ∃ k c, Z_∞ ⊢^{α}_c φ`, finite `c` (finitely many induction
instances ⇒ finitely many finite-rank cuts — the hinge of the whole argument). Sub-targets:
M4.1 (Lemma 16.1, true universal sentences derivable at finite bound), M4.2 (Lemma 16.5/Cor 16.6,
induction axioms at bound `ω·4 # 2rk(φ) # 8`), M4.3 (Thm 16.7, induct over a Hilbert-style proof;
reuse Foundation's finitary `Derivation`, map `∀`→ω-rule). M6 (Hardy lower bound, §17) is
**independent and parallelizable** (M6.1–M6.3 overlap Track 1 `Logic/FastGrowing`; M6.4 = Thm 17.1
is new and likely DOES need the Hardy `k` threaded through a cut-free `Provable₀`).

<details><summary>Superseded lap-2 status (M5 was one open leaf `cutElimStep`)</summary>
Done and **machine-checked** (`lake env lean wip/ZinftyF.lean`, only `cutElimStep` sorry):
- The `Z_∞` calculus `inductive Deriv` over `SyntacticFormula ℒₒᵣ`, **Finset sequents** (set-based,
  per Towsner ⇒ contraction is FREE, no `contr` rule), ω-rule `allω`, ordinal bound `o`, `ℕ∞`
  cut rank `cr`. The `ℕ∞/⊤` blocker is **gone**: `complexity : Form → ℕ` is finite.
- Full predicate-level inference API: `axL/verumR/andI/orI/exI/allω/cut/mono/weakening/cast`,
  contraction free.
- **All three inversion lemmas PROVED** (the syntactic content of cut-elimination):
  `orInvAux`/`Provable.orInv` (§19.2 ∨), `andInvAux`/`Provable.andInvL`/`.andInvR` (§19.3 ∧),
  `allInvAux`/`Provable.allInv` (§19.4 ω/∀). Each by structural induction on `Deriv`, all 8 cases,
  preserving ordinal bound and cut rank.
- `cutElim` (Thm 19.9) reduced to the single open leaf `cutElimStep` (Thm 19.7).

**NEXT (hardest-first): the cut-REDUCTION lemma (Towsner §19.5–19.7), the ordinal-arithmetic
heart of `cutElimStep`.** With all inversions in hand, the reduction lemma is: a top-level cut on a
formula of complexity `= c` between two `Provable _ c` derivations can be replaced by a cut-free-at-
rank-`c` derivation with the ordinal bounds *added* (not `max+1`). The principal-formula reduction
uses the inversions to push the cut to the immediate subformulas (∨/∧ → smaller-complexity cut;
ω/∀ → instantiate at the ∃-witness numeral). Then `cutElimStep` does the transfinite induction over
the derivation eliminating all rank-`c` cuts, raising `α ↦ ω^α`. Likely needs a numeric/Hardy `k`
parameter re-added to `Provable` (Towsner threads `h_{ω^α}(k)` through 19.6/19.7) — assess whether
the `(α,c)` indexing suffices first.

Attack paths:
1. **Continue the `wip/Zinfty.lean` prototype** (E2 encoding — *compiles*). Next: (a) connect
   `AForm` to a faithful arithmetic formula with a real free-variable/substitution layer (replace
   the `ℕ → AForm` family with a single body + numeral substitution), so `rk` is genuinely
   finite; (b) state M3.3 bound-monotonicity lemmas; (c) state M4 embedding + M5 cut-elimination
   theorems as disclosed `sorry`s. Bank each as it typechecks; promote to `src/` when green.
2. **Develop M6 (Hardy domination) via Track 1.** `~/src/lean-formalizations` `Logic/FastGrowing`
   is building `h_α`, monotonicity, and Goodstein-length domination on mathlib's
   `ONote.fastGrowing`. Reuse those for M6.1–M6.3; only M6.4 (Thm 17.1, the cut-free lower bound)
   is new here. (Does NOT block M3–M5 — parallelizable.)
3. **Tackle cut-elimination (M5) on the prototype first**, before the embedding — it is the
   self-contained heart (Towsner §19). **STATUS: M5 is now structured down to ONE leaf.**
   `wip/Zinfty.lean` has `Provable.cutElim` (Thm 19.9, full elimination) *proved* by induction on
   cut rank, reducing entirely to the single open lemma **`Provable.cutElimStep`** (Thm 19.7, one
   level). So the next concrete target is exactly `cutElimStep` = §19 inversions 19.2–19.4 +
   reductions 19.5–19.6 + the principal-`Cut`-on-rank-`c` case. Proving it makes the whole
   cut-elimination machine-checked (mod the embedding M4 and lower bound M6.4). NOTE: `cutElimStep`
   likely needs the numeric/Hardy `k` bound that `Provable` currently elides — re-add a `k : ℕ`
   index to `Provable`/`Deriv.o` first (it threads the `h_{ω^α}(k)` bound through 19.6/19.7).
   *(Resolved lap 3: the `k` index turned out NOT to be needed for cut-elimination.)*

### O2′ — M4 DESIGN DECISION (scouted lap 3, execute lap 4) ⭐
The embedding needs Z_∞ to derive PA's **true defining axioms** (e.g. `n+(m+1)=(n+m)+1`), which the
current calculus CANNOT: `axL` is the clash-based identity (`rel r v ∧ nrel r v ∈ Γ`) and `verumR`
is only `⊤`. Towsner's "True" rule is a **truth-based atomic axiom**. So M4 requires extending the
calculus. Concrete plan:
1. **Atomic truth predicate** — reuse Foundation `Semiformula.Evalm ℕ` (the `standardModel`
   instance for `ℒₒᵣ` over `ℕ`; `=`/`<` decidable). For embedding-substituted formulas (free vars
   replaced by numerals) truth is assignment-independent. **VALIDATED (lap 3)** — this typechecks
   (imports `Foundation.FirstOrder.Arithmetic.Basic.Model`):
   ```
   noncomputable def atomTrue (φ : SyntacticFormula ℒₒᵣ) : Prop :=
     Semiformula.Evalm ℕ (fun _ => 0) (fun _ => 0) φ
   ```
   (`Foundation/.../Semantics/Semantics.lean:241`, `Arithmetic/Basic/Model.lean:25`.)
2. **Add `trueAtom` constructor** to `Deriv`: `(φ : Form) → (φ atomic) → Evalm ℕ … φ → φ ∈ Γ →
   Deriv Γ`, with `o = 0`, `cr = 0`. ⚠️ **This touches the completed cut-elimination**: every
   induction (`orInvAux`, `allInvAux`, `andInvAux`, `cutReduceAllAux`, `atomCutAux`,
   `removeFalsumAux`, `cutElimStepAux`) gains one new leaf case — mostly trivial (like `verumR`),
   EXCEPT `atomCutAux`: a `trueAtom` on the cut atom `rel r v` means `rel r v` is true ⇒ `nrel r v`
   is false ⇒ must remove it from the other premise. So `atomCut` needs a **truth-based false-atomic
   removal** (the genuine §19.2 content, now unavoidable, but only for atomics — decidable ℕ
   arithmetic). Do this extension on a `wip/` copy first; re-green; re-promote.
3. **ε₀** is `ε_ 0` in `Mathlib.SetTheory.Ordinal.Veblen` (first fixed point of `ω^·`); `omegaTower
   c α < ε₀` for `α < ε₀` is the closure fact M5.4/M7 need (ε₀ closed under `ω^·`).
4. Then M4.1 (Lemma 16.1) → M4.2 (Cor 16.6) → M4.3 (Thm 16.7), inducting over a `Peano`-proof
   (`𝗣𝗔⁻ + InductionScheme ℒₒᵣ Set.univ`), reusing Foundation's finitary `Derivation`.

**Caveat on the clean state:** cut-elimination is currently truth-free and axiom-clean precisely
because of clash-`axL`. Adding `trueAtom` re-introduces a (decidable, atomic-only) truth layer.
This is the standard Schütte setup and is correct; just do it carefully so the §19 proofs stay green.

### O3 — `PA_delta1Definable : 𝗣𝗔.Δ₁` (Foundation axiom) — only on Route A
Needed to *state* Gödel II for `𝗣𝗔`; Foundation axiomatizes it (TODO in
`Incompleteness/Examples.lean`). Route B avoids it. Attack paths:
1. **Avoid** — go Route B (O1 path 2); the axiom never enters the headline profile.
2. Discharge it: construct the Δ₁-definition of PA's axiom set (PA⁻ + induction scheme) in
   Foundation's `Theory.Δ₁` framework and prove `isDelta1`. Deep arithmetization; multi-lap.
3. Upstream: check whether a newer Foundation rev proves it (the TODO may get filled upstream);
   file an `ON-LINE-REQUEST.md` to check the latest Foundation `Incompleteness/Examples.lean`.

**UPDATE (lap 6, cross-session news):** a separate session (`~/src/Foundation-delta1-burndown`,
branch `feat/induction-scheme-delta1`) is **actively discharging** both `PA_delta1Definable` and
`ISigma1_delta1Definable` (proving them in `InductionSchemeDelta1.lean`; reduced `PA.Δ₁` to 3 isolated
obligations, build green, ~1–2 laps to PA-complete per that session). So path 3 is in progress
**upstream** — do NOT duplicate it here. When it lands and our Foundation pin bumps to include it,
Route A's `not_proves_of_implies_consistency` becomes axiom-clean (no `PA_delta1Definable`). This is a
**fallback de-risk only**: our headline stays on **Route B** (Towsner direct, avoids `Con(PA)` and this
axiom). `goodstein_implies_consistency` (the `TI(ε₀)⊢Con(PA)`-inside-PA girder of Route A) remains
deeply blocked regardless, so the Δ₁ news doesn't make Route A the preferred path.

## Done — lap 4 (2026-06-22)
- **Witness-bound architectural finding** (machine-checked, axiom-clean, `wip/WitnessBound.lean`):
  the `src/Zinfty.lean` `(α,c)` cut-elimination is OFF the headline path (its unbounded `∃` makes the
  lower bound false). Built the corrected witness-bounded calculus `B`; proved the existential-fragment
  lower bound (`lowerBound_existential[_real]`) grounded against the real `G`; decomposed the full
  Thm 17.1 to the single `bounding` frontier (`True`/`W`/`I∃` cases machine-verified via `sat_mono_ord`,
  `I∀` case the literature-gated frontier; `lowerBound` contradiction-extraction real). Goodstein-side
  grounded: `G`, `goodstein_zero_succ`/`_mono`, `atomTrue_iff_G_le`. Filed `ON-LINE-REQUEST.md` for the
  rigorous `bounding` invariant + architecture (Towsner `(α,k)` vs Buchholz `H`-controlled).
- Next deep brick (architecture-independent, but gated on the notation/architecture decision):
  the **Hardy / fast-growing hierarchy + τ-controlled monotonicity** to discharge `Hmono`/`Hmono_n`,
  and **Goodstein domination** (Towsner §5–§9) to discharge `Hdom`. mathlib `ONote.fastGrowing`
  exists but has NO growth lemmas (deliberately minimal).
  - **STARTED** (`wip/FastGrowing.lean`, axiom-clean): `fastGrowing_id_le` — `n ≤ fastGrowing o n`
    (the inflationary half, which IS separable from ordinal-monotonicity: successor case via
    iterating a `≥id` map, limit case via the smaller-ordinal IH).
  - **Confirmed entangled:** *numeric* monotonicity (`Hmono_n` analogue) of `fastGrowing` — its
    limit case `fastGrowing (f m) m ≤ fastGrowing (f m') m` needs *ordinal* monotonicity at fixed `n`,
    which is the τ-subtle one (false for small `n` without the coefficient control — Towsner §8). So
    `Hmono`/`Hmono_n` for the real hierarchy genuinely need the τ machinery; not a quick brick.

## Done — lap 1
- M1: `Encoding.goodsteinTerminates_re` proved (`Computability.lean`: `primrec_natLog`,
  `primrec_bump`, `primrec_goodsteinSeq`). Phase 0 axiom-clean.
- M2: `Reduction.lean` — Gödel II hook + meta-reduction (axiom-clean mod `PA_delta1Definable`).
- Phase 2: `PHASE2-DECOMPOSITION.md` (Towsner-grounded ladder) + `wip/Zinfty.lean` (E2 encoding
  prototype — compiles: ω-rule inductive, ordinal/cut-rank measures, bound-domination lemma,
  `Provable.mono`/`.weakening`, and the **proved predicate-level inference API** `Provable.orI`,
  `.exI`, `.allI` — the ω-rule with the supremum ordinal bound, machine-checked against the
  `Deriv` measures via `Classical.choice`).

## ⭐ KEY FINDING (2026-06-22, end of lap) — build `Z_∞` ON Foundation's Tait calculus
Foundation **already has a finitary Tait one-sided FO sequent calculus**:
`FirstOrder/Basic/Calculus.lean` — `inductive Derivation (𝓢 : Schema L) : Sequent L → Type`
with constructors `axL, verum, or, and, all, exs, wk, cut` and a `height` measure, over the *real*
`SyntacticFormula ℒₒᵣ` (which already carries free variables, substitution, negation, rank).
Plus `FirstOrder/Hauptsatz.lean` (finitary cut-elimination). **There is NO infinitary calculus /
ω-rule / `PA_∞`** (confirmed by grep — only finitary Tait + Hauptsatz).

**Consequence — revise M3.1:** do NOT continue the standalone `wip/Zinfty.lean` `AForm`. Instead
define `Z_∞` as a new inductive **over Foundation's `SyntacticFormula ℒₒᵣ`/`Sequent`**, replacing
the finitary `all` (eigenvariable, one premise, `ℕ` height) with the **ω-rule** (`all` taking an
`ℕ`-indexed family `n ↦ φ[x ↦ numeral n]`, `Ordinal` height). This:
- **kills the `AForm` substitution-layer prerequisite** — Foundation's formula substitution +
  `rk` are reused, so `rk φ` is already finite and `cut`/`cutElimStep` become directly stateable;
- **shrinks M4 (embedding):** a PA proof already yields a Foundation *finitary* `Derivation`
  (via Hauptsatz machinery); M4 becomes "finitary `Derivation` ↪ `Z_∞`" (map each rule across,
  ∀→ω-rule) instead of re-deriving from `True`/`Lemma 16.1` by hand;
- **makes M7 natural:** everything is over real `ℒₒᵣ` formulas, so connecting to our
  `goodsteinSentence` is a formula-level statement, not a re-encoding.
The `wip/Zinfty.lean` prototype keeps its value as the *proof that the ordinal/ω-rule measures
work* (the encoding-feasibility result) — port its `o`/`cr`/`allI`/`cutElim` skeleton onto
Foundation's `Derivation`-shaped inductive. **This is the recommended first action next lap**
(read `FirstOrder/Basic/Calculus.lean` + `Hauptsatz.lean` first).

## Design note — `Provable.cut` + the `ℕ∞` cut-rank (next lap, read before refactoring)
`cr : Deriv Γ → ℕ∞` (cut rank can be `⊤` for pathological infinite families). A predicate-level
`Provable.cut` is the one rule still missing: from `Provable α c (φ ::ₘ Γ)` and
`Provable β c (φ.neg ::ₘ Γ)` it should give `Provable (max α β + 1) c' (Γ)` where
`c' ≥ rk φ + 1`. But `rk φ : ℕ∞` may be `⊤`, so you can't pick a finite `c' : ℕ` in general —
`Provable`'s `c : ℕ`. **Fix:** when `AForm` gets the real free-variable + numeral-substitution
layer (the M3.1 refinement), `rk φ` becomes provably finite (`rk φ ≠ ⊤`) for genuine formulas, so
`Provable.cut` and the Hardy-bounded `cutElimStep` both become stateable with finite `c`. So the
substitution-layer refactor is a prerequisite for *both* `cut` and `cutElimStep` — do it first.

## Gotcha noted (for the corpus)
For `Ordinal`, `add_le_add_right h c` elaborates to `c + a ≤ c + b` (adds on the *left*) — use
`add_le_add h le_rfl` to get `a + 1 ≤ b + 1` from `a ≤ b`. `gcongr` on `⨆`-bounds spawns a
`BddAbove (Set.range …)` side-goal (discharge with `Ordinal.bddAbove_range`).

## lap 48 — internal Cor 3.4 bricks landed; MinExpGe assembly remaining (2026-06-23)
DONE (axiom-clean, green): `icmp_iadd_clean`/`_boundary` (within+boundary unified), `iC_iadd_clean`
(C-split = Grz.C_add_clean), `iAbove_iomul` (MinExpGe step: `iAbove e0 a → iAbove (1+e0)(ω·a)`),
`iAbove_zero_iomul` (MinExpGe base: `iAbove 0 (ω·a)`). Plus general `icmp_swap` antisymmetry infra
in InternalONote.

REMAINING for the `iAbove (ocExp g) (ibigMul (l+1) β)` clean-condition (3 attack paths):
1. **Meta-iterate (recommended).** By `induction k:ℕ`: `iAbove (oadd1iter k 0) (ibigMul (k+1) β)`
   from base `iAbove_zero_iomul` + step `iAbove_iomul` (needs `isNF_ibigMul` for the NF arg, exists).
   `oadd1iter k = (iadd (ocOadd 0 1 0))^[k]`. Then identify `oadd1iter k 0 = ocOadd 0 k 0` (finite k)
   via `iadd_one_zero`/`iadd_one_fin`, and weaken the threshold `ofin l → ocExp g` (g < ω^(l+1) ⟹
   ocExp g ⪯ ofin l).
2. **Threshold weakening** is the one piece needing care: `iAbove (ofin l) a → (ocExp g ⪯ ofin l) →
   iAbove (ocExp g) a`. Since g's exps are FINITE codes (ig0/iblk have finite ocExp), the spine-vs-
   threshold comparisons are all finite (cmpV on coeffs) OR infinite-head-vs-finite
   (`icmp_infHead_finHead`) — provable WITHOUT general `icmp` transitivity. State as
   `icmp_spine_finThresh_mono : icmp s (ofin (l+1)) = 2 → j ≤ l → icmp s (ofin j) = 2` by cases on s.
3. Alternatively prove general `icmp_trans` (≺ transitive) once — heavier but unblocks everything.

Then assemble `icorAlpha` (mirror `Grz.corAlpha`): C-bound (`iC_iadd_clean`+`iC_ibigMul_le`+`iC` of g),
within (`icmp_iadd_clean` with `icmp a a`=1 via the same-lead), boundary (`icmp_iadd_clean_boundary`
+ `icmp_ibigMul` lifting β-descent). Feeds `DescentSemantic.nonterminating_of_xDescent`.
