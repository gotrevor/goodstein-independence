# PROBE / TARGET: the exact Hardy–fast-growing bridge at `ω^α`

Corrects lap-177's claim "the substrate has no fast-growing `F`": `ONote.fastGrowing` IS defined
(mathlib) and the repo carries its full growth theory (`Hardy.lean` §Basic).  The repo's B4 note
(`Hardy.lean:1082`) calls the bridge `H_{ω^α} = f_α`; kernel checks this session show that EQUALITY
is off by TWO successive shift subtleties (both convincing-identity traps caught by `#eval` /
strict-monotonicity):
  1. `H_{ω^α}(n) = f_α(n)` is false — `H_{ω^1}(3)=7 ≠ 6=f_1(3)`; the shifted `=` is
     `H_{ω^α}(n) + 1 = f_α(n+1)` (kernel-`#eval`-anchored α ∈ {0,1,2}).
  2. But even THAT `=` holds only at successor/finite exponents; at LIMIT exponents it degrades to
     STRICT `<` (fund.-seq. index `f n` vs `f(n+1)`, `fastGrowing` strictly ordinal-monotone).

So the UNCONDITIONAL, load-bearing truth is the INEQUALITY

    hardy (oadd α 1 0) n + 1 ≤ fastGrowing α (n + 1)          -- H_{ω^α}(n) < f_α(n+1)

— which is EXACTLY the upper bound the P1 raised-control obligation needs: with `raise e α' =
e + ω^{α'}` in the ABSORBING regime (lap 178), the raised control is `≈ hardy(ω^{α'})`, and this
bound (`hardy_omega_pow_lt_fastGrowing`) reduces P1 to E–W Lemma 19 `fastGrowing α' ≤ f^{iterate}`.

Pure Hardy/fastGrowing growth theory about STABLE defs (mathlib `fastGrowing` + repo `hardy`);
calculus-independent (no `Zeh`, no pin, no cut-elim machinery); the repo's own long-horizon target
B4, sharpened to its true ONote inequality form.  **Base + LIMIT cases proven**; the successor case
(the coefficient intermediate `H_{ω^β·(m+1)}`, the classical Cichoń–Wainer core) is the open grind.

example : hardy (oadd 0 1 0) 3 + 1 = fastGrowing 0 (3 + 1) := by native_decide

example : hardy (oadd 2 1 0) 2 + 1 = fastGrowing 2 (2 + 1) := by native_decide

-- and the EQUALITY H_{ω^α}=f_α is FALSE (off by ≥1) — recorded so no lap re-attempts it:
example : hardy (oadd 1 1 0) 3 ≠ fastGrowing 1 3 := by native_decide

/-! **The `=` is limit-conditional — the UNCONDITIONAL truth is `≤`.**  Kernel-reasoned: at a LIMIT
exponent `α` (fund. seq. `f`), `H_{ω^α}(n) = H_{ω^{f n}}(n)` uses `f n`, while `f_α(n+1) =
f_{f(n+1)}(n+1)` uses `f(n+1) > f n`; `fastGrowing` is strictly monotone in the ordinal, so the LHS
is STRICTLY smaller — the equality FAILS at limits (a third convincing-identity refinement this
session; `fastGrowing ω`-scale values are too large to `#eval`, but the strict-monotone argument is
decisive).  The `native_decide` anchors above (α ∈ {0,1,2}, all successor/finite exponents) are
exactly the regime where `=` holds.  So the load-bearing target is the INEQUALITY below — and that is
precisely the UPPER bound P1 needs. -/

/-- **Composition lemma (the equal-exponent additive core) — the SOLE remaining open obligation.**
`H_{ω^β·(k+2)}(n) = H_{ω^β·(k+1)}(H_{ω^β}(n))`: the non-absorbing additive identity
`H_{γ + ω^β} = H_γ ∘ H_{ω^β}` at `γ = ω^β·(k+1)` (leading exponents both `β`, so NO absorption —
contrast the absorbing case refuted in `HardyAddProbe.lean`).  Kernel-verified β ∈ {0,1,2}.  Follows
from the non-absorbing LIMIT fs-homomorphism (`fundamentalSequence (γ + δ) = (γ + ·)∘fs δ` when
`δ`'s leading exp ≤ `γ`'s trailing exp) — the branch `HardyAddProbe` proved only for successors.  -/

`H_{ω^β·(m+1)}(n) + 1 ≤ f_β^{[m+1]}(n+1)`.  Kernel-verified for β ∈ {0,1}.  Induction on the
coefficient `m`: base `m=0` is `hbase`; the step composes via `hardy_omega_pow_coeff_comp` + the IH +
iterate-monotonicity — so this lemma is PROVEN modulo the composition lemma. -/

  `H_{ω^β·(m+1)}(n) + 1 = f_β^{[m+1]}(n+1)` (kernel-verified β∈{0,1}), proved by induction on the
