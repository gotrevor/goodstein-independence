# `Trap8Probe` — the EIGHTH statement trap: the diagonalizing `iterSlot` is NOT
ordinal-monotone, so the LOCKED pin-3 output slot `iterSlot f α` cannot be threaded
through the cut-elimination induction.

The pin (`cutElimPass_Zf`, judge-LOCKED lap-5 form) reads
    `Zef α e H f (c+1) Γ → … → ZefProv (collapse α) e H (iterSlot f α) c Γ`.
A structural induction on the derivation produces, at every sub-derivation of recorded
height `β < α` (the `weak`, `exI`, `allω`, `cut` premises), the IH
    `ZefProv (collapse β) e H (iterSlot f β) c …`,
because the motive keys the output slot to the node's height.  To re-assemble at the
PARENT node (output slot `iterSlot f α`) the ONLY available slot move is `Zef.mono_f`,
which RAISES a slot: it needs `∀ x, iterSlot f β x ≤ iterSlot f α x`.

**Kernel refutation below**: with `f = (·+1)` (monotone + inflationary), `β = ofNat 2`,
`α = ω = oadd 1 1 0` (both NF, `β < α`), we have `iterSlot f 2 0 = 3 > 2 = iterSlot f ω 0`.
So the `mono_f` premise the induction requires is FALSE.  Root cause: the diagonalizing
iterate (trap-7's fix) DIPS at the base of a limit — `iterSlot f ω 0` rides the
fundamental-sequence value `ω[0] = 1` (`iterSlot f ω 0 = iterSlot f 1 0 = f^[2] 0`), which
is *smaller* than a finite `β = 2` sitting below ω (`iterSlot f 2 0 = f^[3] 0`).  trap-7
fixed the `allω`-branch unboundedness (branch index rides a LARGE argument `max n x`); the
fix reintroduced a BASE-argument domination failure that bites at every node whose slot is
read near argument 0 (`weak` slot-lift; `exI`/`cut` witness at 0).

Same evidence grade as traps 6/7: kernel-localized + structurally forced (the slot algebra
offers only the one-directional `mono_f`; no auxiliary with a bare-`iterSlot f α` conclusion
can dodge it — the IH is pinned to `iterSlot f β` by the theorem's own motive).  NOT a
falsity proof of the full pin — an unprovable-as-stated obstruction with the wall
kernel-anchored, sufficient for a statement amendment under the mandate.

Read-only evidence artifact; do NOT wire into `src`.  Escalation:

/-- **The SHARP obstruction — statement-level impossibility, not merely an `iterSlot` defect.**
NO output-slot map `S : ONote → ℕ` read at a FIXED argument can be BOTH:
  (a) **ordinal-monotone** `β < α → S β ≤ S α` (needed to lift a `β < α` sub-derivation's slot to
      the parent's via `Zef.mono_f`), AND
  (b) **unbounded along the finite ordinals** `n ≤ S (ofNat n)` (forced: the exit witness bound
      grows with the derivation's ordinal — a bounded slot cannot capture cut-elimination growth).
Reason: `ofNat n < ω` for every `n`, so (a) gives `S (ofNat n) ≤ S ω`, whence (b) gives `n ≤ S ω`
for all `n` — impossible for the single natural number `S ω`.  (This is the well-order fact that a
monotone `ONote → ℕ` cannot dominate its own restriction to a fundamental sequence of a limit.)

So trap 8 is NOT "pick a better iterate at argument 0": every fixed-argument slot-read fails.  The
C2 fix MUST make the slot-read **node-relative** — the argument at which the slot is consulted has
to grow with the ordinal (the diagonalization aligning with the node's level), so
`iterSlot_le_of_reaches` monotonicity (which holds at LARGE argument) applies at every node. -/
