# wip/PathCOmega.lean — Path C, brick 1: the stored-ordinal ω-∀-node (lap 102→)

**Purpose (see `HANDOFF-2026-06-25-lap102.md`, `NEXT_STEPS.md` PRIORITY 1).** Probe 2 (lap 102,
`wip/InternalZomega.lean`) settled the crux-2 sub-route fork in favour of **Path C** (the ω-rule), with the
refinement that the ordinal layer must be REPLACED by **stored** ordinals (Buchholz operator-controlled
derivations), not the computed `iord` — because the induction ω-node's ordinal is a genuine limit
(`iotil_zK_iIndReduct_strictMono`) the finite-`#`-fold `iord` cannot assign.

This file begins the arithmetized stored-ordinal datatype. **Brick 1 = the ω-∀-node**, the cleanest case
(its premises are eigensubsts, ordinal-PRESERVING), where the stored ordinal can be taken to be the
existing finitary `zIall` node's own `iord` and the descent side-condition is the banked
`iord_descent_zIall`. This pins the Path-C node design in-kernel and shows the existing I∀ embedding
realizes it wholesale — the ∀-cut half of the `Zinfty.cutElimStep` analogue, on the existing engine.

## Design (Buchholz §6 `Z*` / Towsner `ZinftyF.Deriv`, arithmetized)

An ω-∀-node is `zAllOmega s d0 a α` = `⟪s, 7, d0, a, α⟫ + 1` (tag 7): conclusion sequent `s = Γ→∀x F`,
premise generator `d0` (the eigenvariable premise deriving `Γ→F(a)`), eigenvariable `a`, **stored ordinal**
`α` (a CNF code). The premise family is `t ↦ zsubst d0 a t` (Buchholz `Z*`: `h[t] = h₀(x/t)`), materialized
on demand — never stored, so no `Fixpoint.StrongFinite` issue. **Validity** (`zAllOmegaValid`) asserts: the
premise family is uniformly valid AND every premise ordinal is `≺ α` (the stored side-condition — fully Σ₁,
NO sup/limit operation, the whole point of the stored design). A critical ∀-cut SELECTS premise `t` and the
reduction drops the ordinal below `α` for free (second validity conjunct). -/

/-- **Stored-ordinal ω-∀-node validity.** The premise family is uniformly valid (`ZDerivation` for every
closed `t`), and every premise ordinal is strictly below the stored ordinal `α`. The second conjunct is the
Buchholz operator-control side-condition — a bounded Σ₁ statement over the family, with NO ordinal-sup.
(The conclusion `_s` is carried for API/definability uniformity; the conclusion-TRACKING conjunct
`fstIdx (zsubst d0 a t) = seqSetSucc s (F t)` is the spike's `zOmegaPrem_concl`, added in a later brick
once the O3 freshness data is threaded — deferred here to keep brick 1 minimal.) -/

/-- **Brick 1 — a regular finitary `zIall` REALIZES the stored-ordinal ω-∀-node**, with the stored ordinal
taken to be the finitary node's own `iord`. The premise family is valid (`ZDerivation_zsubst_zIall_premise`,
freshness bound only), and each premise's ordinal `= iord d0 ≺ iord (zIall …)` (the banked
`iord_descent_zIall`, via `iord_zsubst`). So the existing I∀ embedding produces a valid Path-C ω-node for
free — the stored side-condition is exactly the banked descent, no new infrastructure. This is the ∀-cut
case of the `Zinfty.cutElimStep` ordinal drop, arithmetized on the existing engine. -/

/-- **The ω-∀-cut reduct descends below the stored ordinal — UNIFORMLY in the witness.** A critical ∀-cut
on `∀x F` with the ω-node on the R-side selects premise `zsubst d0 a t` (no new substitution); its ordinal
is `≺ α` directly from validity. This is the Path-C ∀-cut termination measure — the stored-ordinal analogue
of the spike's `iord_descent_zOmegaPrem`, now reading the side-condition off the node data rather than
recomputing. The full `cutElimStep` (all cut shapes) is brick 2 (`sorry` below). -/

/-! ### Brick 1, completed — conclusion-TRACKING (the deferred `zAllOmegaValid` conjunct)

The minimal `zAllOmegaValid` dropped conclusion-tracking. Here it is, with the eigenvariable side-condition
O3 supplied explicitly (the embedding's fresh-eigenvariable choice gives it). The full validity predicate
`zAllOmegaValidFull` is the complete Path-C ω-∀-node datum: premise family valid + conclusion-tracked +
ordinal-bounded by the stored `α` — and a regular finitary `zIall` realizes ALL THREE. -/

/-- **Conclusion-tracking for the ω-∀-node premise.** Premise-`t` derives exactly `Γ→F(t)`
(`= seqSetSucc s (substs1 t p)`), given the O3 eigenvariable side-condition (`a` substitution-invariant in
the matrix `p` and antecedent `Γ`) — Buchholz's condition supplied at the I∀ node, NOT re-discharged per
cut. The reduct's conclusion is COMPUTED, never threaded through a motive (the contrast with the finitary
`tpReduce`/`redZKReady` machinery). -/

conjuncts), with stored ordinal = the node's own `iord`. The existing I∀ embedding produces a complete,
valid Path-C ω-node — validity (`ZDerivation_zsubst_zIall_premise`), conclusion (`zAllOmega_concl`), and the

/-! ## Brick 3 kernel — the INDUCTION ω-node's stored ordinal (the limit case)

Probe 2 (`wip/InternalZomega.lean`) showed the induction ω-node's premise ordinals strictly increase in
the unfolding depth, so its ordinal is a genuine LIMIT the computed `iord` cannot reach. The stored design
sidesteps this: assign the node a FIXED ordinal `α` that provably dominates the whole premise family, and
require `∀k, o(premise k) ≺ α` as data. Here we DISCHARGE that side-condition in-kernel — the limit is
assignable as a fixed code and dominates every finite unfolding. -/

/-- **The induction ω-node's stored ordinal** = `ω_{dg}(ω^{õ d1 + 1} # ω^{õ d0})`, where `dg = idg (zInd s
at' p d0 d1)` is the unfolding's (k-independent) degree. The õ-part is the `k→∞` limit of the depth-`k`
unfolding's õ `ω^{õ d1}·k # ω^{õ d0}` (Probe 2) — the smallest CNF code dominating the whole family. -/
noncomputable def indOmegaStoredOrd (s at' p d0 d1 : V) : V :=
  iotower (inadd (ocOadd (iadd (iotil d1) (ocOadd 0 1 0)) 1 0) (ocOadd (iotil d0) 1 0))
    (idg (zInd s at' p d0 d1))

/-- **Brick 3 kernel — the stored ordinal BOUNDS every induction premise (iord level), uniformly in `k`.**
For NF premise õs, the depth-`k` unfolding's ordinal `iord (zK s' (irk p) (iIndReductSeq d0 d1 k)) ≺
indOmegaStoredOrd …` for ALL `k > 0`. Proof: the degree is constant (`idg_zK_iIndReduct`), so the
comparison lifts (`icmp_iotower_mono`) from the õ-bound `ω^{õ d1}·k # ω^{õ d0} ≺ ω^{õ d1 + 1} # ω^{õ d0}`,
which is `inadd_right_mono` applied to the banked `icmp_term_lt_omega_succ` (`ω^β·k ≺ ω^{β+1}`, all finite
`k`). This is the Buchholz operator-control side-condition for the induction ω-node, DISCHARGED — the limit
Probe 2 showed `iord` can't compute, assigned as a fixed code that provably dominates the family.

**Carrier note (design honesty).** The premise here is the FINITARY unfolding `zK … (iIndReductSeq …)`,
which under the true ω-rule (Towsner `ZinftyF.Deriv`) would be a cut-TREE deriving `F(k)`, not a Buchholz
K-chain. So this exact node is NOT the final Path-C induction node — but the ORDINAL fact IS path-portable:
Buchholz combines cut-premise ordinals by the same `#`-natural-sum, so a cut-tree unfolding of depth `k`
carries the same õ `ω^{õd1}·k # ω^{õd0}`, dominated by the same limit. This lemma stands as (i) Probe-2
evidence that the limit is the right stored ordinal, and (ii) a reusable ordinal bound for the eventual
cut-tree node. -/

/-! ### Brick 3 — packaging the induction ω-node (node + validity + realization)

Mirroring brick 1 (`zAllOmega`/`zAllOmegaValid`/`zIall_realizes_zAllOmegaValid`), here is the induction
ω-node as a Path-C datatype: a node `zIndOmega` (tag 8), a validity predicate `zIndOmegaValid` (premise
family uniformly valid AND every depth-`k` unfolding's `iord ≺ the stored limit ordinal`), and the
realization theorem — a regular finitary `zInd` realizes the Path-C induction ω-node with stored ordinal =
the fixed limit `indOmegaStoredOrd`, ALL THREE conjuncts axiom-clean from banked lemmas.

The premise carrier here is the engine's finitary unfolding `iIndReductSeq d0 d1 k = ⟨d1,…,d1,d0⟩` (the
depth-`k` chain), per the carrier note on `iord_iIndReduct_lt_storedBound`: the ORDINAL fact is
path-portable (the eventual cut-tree unfolding of depth `k` carries the same õ), and the per-premise
`ZDerivation`-hood (`znth_iIndReductSeq_ZDerivation`) is a genuine, motive-free fact — exactly the
premise-family validity the stored-ordinal ω-node datum requires (no `zKValid` chain wall, since validity
is read per-premise, never as a whole-chain reduct). -/

/-- **The Path-C stored-ordinal induction ω-node** (tag 8). `s` conclusion, `at'`/`p` the induction data,
`d0`/`d1` the base/step premises, `α` the STORED limit ordinal. The premise family is the depth-`k`
unfolding `k ↦ iIndReductSeq d0 d1 k` (computed on demand). -/
noncomputable def zIndOmega (s at' p d0 d1 α : V) : V := ⟪s, 8, at', p, d0, d1, α⟫ + 1

/-- **Stored-ordinal induction ω-node validity.** Every premise of every depth-`k` unfolding (`k > 0`) is a
`ZDerivation`, and every depth-`k` unfolding's ordinal `iord (zK s' (irk p) (iIndReductSeq d0 d1 k))` is
strictly below the stored limit `α`, uniformly in `k` and the unfolding's conclusion sequent `s'`. The
second conjunct is the Buchholz operator-control side-condition for the induction node — the genuine LIMIT
Probe 2 (`iotil_zK_iIndReduct_strictMono`) showed the computed `iord` cannot reach, here discharged as a
fixed `α` that provably dominates the whole family (`iord_iIndReduct_lt_storedBound`, brick 3 kernel). -/
def zIndOmegaValid (p d0 d1 α : V) : Prop :=
  (∀ k, 0 < k → ∀ i < lh (iIndReductSeq d0 d1 k), ZDerivation (znth (iIndReductSeq d0 d1 k) i)) ∧
  (∀ s' k, 0 < k → icmp (iord (zK s' (irk p) (iIndReductSeq d0 d1 k))) α = 0)

/-- **Brick 3 capstone — a regular finitary `zInd` REALIZES the stored-ordinal induction ω-node**, with the
stored ordinal taken to be the fixed limit `indOmegaStoredOrd`. Premise-family validity is the motive-free
`znth_iIndReductSeq_ZDerivation` (each Ind-unfolding premise is `d0` or `d1`, both `ZDerivation`s by
`zDerivation_zInd_inv`); the limit-domination side-condition is exactly brick 3's
`iord_iIndReduct_lt_storedBound` (the NF hypotheses are free from `isNF_iotil_of_ZDerivation`). So the
existing native `zInd` node produces a complete, valid Path-C induction ω-node whose stored ordinal is the
genuine limit — the case the computed `iord` provably cannot assign. This is the induction analogue of
`zIall_realizes_zAllOmegaValid`. -/

/-! ## Brick 4 skeleton — the stored-ordinal infinite descent (path-portable)

**Endgame design (clarified lap 102).** Two distinct cut-elimination reductions exist; Path C uses the
RIGHT one:
- *Towsner/Zinfty `cutElimStep`* (rank `c+1→c`, ordinal `α↦ω^α`) — used for the META proof (`Zinfty.lean`),
  iterated `c` times by `cutElim`. The ordinal INCREASES per step; this gives "terminates at cut-free", not
  a single-step drop. NOT the Path-C reduction.
- *Buchholz `red`* (Def 3.2, operator-controlled) — a single reduction step that STRICTLY DROPS the
  (stored) ordinal while preserving the conclusion. This is the repo's finitary `red`, and the right Path-C
  reduction: iterating it on an ∅→⊥ derivation gives an infinite ε₀-descent (the ∅→⊥ sequent has no
  cut-free proof, so `red` never terminates), which crux-1's PRWO(ε₀) forbids. The bricks above ARE the
  per-node drops of this `red`: brick 1 (∀-cut selects premise, ord ≺ stored αR), brick 3 (induction node,
  ord bounded by the stored limit). The descent skeleton below packages the iteration, exactly mirroring
  `Crux2Blueprint.iord_red_iterate_descends` but on STORED ordinals (path-portable, no `iord` engine). -/

/-- **Brick 4 skeleton — iterated stored-ordinal descent.** A per-step strict drop of the stored ordinal
gives an infinite `≺`-descent `n ↦ ord (red^[n] z)`. The Path-C analogue of
`Crux2Blueprint.iord_red_iterate_descends`, abstracted over the stored-ordinal map `ord` and the
single-step reduction `step` — so it consumes exactly the per-node drops (bricks 1, 3) and feeds crux-1's
PRWO(ε₀)/`gentzen_descent_of_inconsistent`. Path-portable: no dependence on the computed `iord` engine. -/

/-! ## NEXT BRICKS (Path C, `sorry`-disclosed milestones — PENDING_WORK lap 102)

Brick 1 above pins the ω-∀-node design + its cut invariant on the existing engine. The remaining Path-C
datatype (each a `wip/` milestone, ported from `ZinftyF.Deriv`/`o`/`cr`):

- **Brick 2 — `cutElimStep` (the single rank drop).** The full Schütte/Tait reduction over all node shapes
  (`Zinfty.cutElimStep`/`cutElimPrincipal`, Towsner §19.7): a rank-`c+1` derivation reduces to rank-`c` with
  stored ordinal `α ↦ ω^α`. The ∀-cut case = brick 1; the ∧/∨/atom cases are the other `cutReduce*`.
- **Brick 3 — the induction ω-node.** Kernel DONE above (`indOmegaStoredOrd` + `iord_iIndReduct_lt_storedBound`):
  the stored limit ordinal provably dominates every finite unfolding's `iord`, uniformly in `k`. Remaining:
  package it as a node + validity (premise-family `ZDerivation`s via `znth_iIndReductSeq_ZDerivation`, the
  conclusion-tracking `F(k)`, the Σ₁ side-condition), mirroring `zAllOmega`/`zAllOmegaValid`.
- **Brick 4 — `false_of_ZDerivesEmpty` (Path C).** SKELETON DONE (`stored_ord_iterate_descends`): the
  iteration of a per-step stored-ordinal drop. `red` = one Buchholz `red` step (NOT Zinfty `cutElimStep` —
  see the endgame design note above); the ∅→⊥ sequent has no cut-free proof, so `red` never terminates ⟹
  stored ordinal strictly descends forever ⟹ infinite ε₀-descent ⟹ contradicts PRWO(ε₀) (crux-1). Remaining:
  define `red` on the datatype (so `hdrop` is discharged by bricks 1/3) + wire to
  `gentzen_descent_of_inconsistent`. No chain, no `redZKReady`.
- **Σ₁-definability** of `zAllOmega`/`zAllOmegaValid` (the `⟪…⟫`/`icmp`/`iord` pieces are all already
  `𝚺₁`/`𝚫₁`; this is bookkeeping, deferred until the datatype shape stabilizes). -/
