# The witness bound: why the current `src/Zinfty.lean` cut-elimination cannot reach the headline

**Lap-4 architectural finding (2026-06-22).**  `src/GoodsteinPA/Zinfty.lean` machine-checks a
beautiful, axiom-clean ε₀ cut-elimination for the `Z_∞` calculus.  But that calculus's `∃`-rule
(`Deriv.exI`) places **no bound on the witness numeral** relative to the ordinal: `exI φ n d`
accepts *any* `n : ℕ` and only does `o ↦ o + 1`.  The ordinal measure `o` does not track Towsner's
numeric index `k`, and there is no Hardy bound `value(t) ≤ h_α(k)` on witnesses.

Towsner's whole unprovability argument is a sandwich:

  Thm 16.7  (M4, embedding)        PA⁺ ⊢ φ  ⟹  ∃ α<ε₀, k, c.  Z_∞ ⊢^{α,k}_c φ
  Thm 19.9  (M5, cut-elimination)  Z_∞ ⊢^{α,k}_c φ  ⟹  Z_∞ ⊢^{α',k}_0 φ,  α'<ε₀   [DONE for (α,c)]
  Thm 17.1  (M6, lower bound)      no cut-free Z_∞ ⊢^{α,k}_0  ∀x∃y g_y(x)=0  for α<ε₀

The **bottom slice (17.1) is the load-bearing inequality** — it is *why* PA cannot prove Goodstein.
Its proof inducts on α and, at the `I∃` step, uses the witness bound `value(t) ≤ h_α(k) < G(n)` to
force the introduced atom `g_t(n)=0` to be **false**.  Drop the witness bound and the lower bound
is simply **false**: one can take the witness to be `G(n)` itself.

This file makes that undeniable.  `unbounded_proves_goodstein` below is a *machine-checked* proof
that the witness-**unbounded** cut-free calculus (the structural analogue of the current
`src/Zinfty.lean`) derives the Goodstein sentence at ordinal **2** — so no lower bound can hold for
it, and the completed `(α,c)` cut-elimination, however clean, **cannot** reach the headline.

The fix (Towsner-faithful) is the **witness-bounded, Hardy-indexed** calculus `B` below: the `∃`-rule
carries `v ≤ h α k`, the `True` rule carries `τ α < k`, and the `∀`-rule's premises use numeric
bound `max k n`.  The lower bound (`lowerBound`) is then *true* — stated here against the abstract
Hardy data `(h, τ, G)`, proof deferred (a genuine frontier; see the invariant note on `lowerBound`).

Self-contained over an abstract atomic base (`atom m n` = "`g_m(n)=0`", true iff
`goodsteinSeq n m = 0`), exactly the standard Schütte/Tait setup.  WIP — not in the build target.

terminates (Goodstein's theorem, `Hterm` — *true*, and exactly what the headline is about), the
witness-**unbounded** cut-free calculus derives the full Goodstein sentence `∀x∃y g_y(x)=0` at
ordinal `2`.  Hence **no** lower bound à la Towsner 17.1 can hold for this calculus, and the
clean `(α,c)` cut-elimination of `src/Zinfty.lean` — which never constrains witnesses — cannot be
the cut-free system that the headline needs.  The witness bound (calculus `B` below) is essential. -/

/-! ## The witness-**bounded**, Hardy-indexed calculus `B` — the corrected architecture (Towsner §15)

The bounds are an ordinal `α` (height) and a numeric index `k`.  The data controlling witnesses:

* `h : Ordinal → ℕ → ℕ`  — the Hardy hierarchy `h_α` (Towsner Def 6.3),
* `τ : Ordinal → ℕ`      — ordinal complexity (Towsner Def 8.1).

Rules (Towsner §15), cut-free (`c = 0`):

* `True`:  a true atom in `Γ`, side condition `τ α < k`;
* `W`   :  from `Δ ⊆ Γ`, premise bound `β < α`, `τ β < k`;
* `I∃`  :  **witness bound** `v ≤ h α k`, premise bound `β < α`, `τ β < k`;
* `I∀`  :  ω-rule, premise `n` at numeric bound `max k n`, ordinal `β n < α`, `τ (β n) < max k n`.

/-- **The `∃`-side lower bound — the witness bound's load-bearing consequence, machine-checked.**

Restricted to the `∀`-free Goodstein fragment (sequents of pending existentials `∃y g_y(n)=0` and
false atoms `g_m(n)=0`), the witness-bounded cut-free calculus *cannot* derive a sequent all of
whose existentials are "out of reach" — `h α k < G n` — and all of whose atoms are false (`m < G n`,
i.e. `g_m(n) ≠ 0`).  This is *exactly why the witness bound bites*: every `∃` the calculus can
discharge introduces an atom `g_v(n)=0` with `v ≤ h α k < G n`, which is **false**, so the leaf can
never be closed by the `True` rule, and the ordinal strictly descends — a well-founded impossibility.

Compare `unbounded_proves_goodstein`: without the witness bound, the witness can be `G n` and the
identical sequent *is* derivable.  The two theorems together pin the witness bound as the precise
mechanism separating "headline-reaching" from "vacuous" cut-free `Z_∞`.

Hypotheses (Towsner §6/§8 facts, supplied abstractly — discharged later from the Hardy hierarchy):
* `Hmono`  `h_β(k) ≤ h_α(k)` for `β < α` with `τ β < k`            (Lemma 16.10, monotonicity),
* `HG`     a true atom `g_m(n)=0` forces `m ≥ G n`                 (Goodstein reaches `0` at `G n`).

The full Towsner 17.1 (with the Goodstein **sentence** `∀x∃y g_y(x)=0` present, hence the `I∀`
ω-rule and *accumulating* existentials) needs a more refined invariant than Towsner states — see
`ON-LINE-REQUEST.md` and the lap-4 note in `STATUS.md`; that is the remaining frontier (`gAll`-case). -/
