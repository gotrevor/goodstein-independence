# Wainer/Cichon/Caicedo growth-rate route

This module is the new route spine after the 2026-07-01 route decision.  The old
active route tried to derive `Con(PA)` from Goodstein inside PA and then use Godel II.
That forced an IΣ₁-internalized cut-elimination bridge.  The lap-171 M2 probe found
the decisive obstruction: the PA-induction leaf wants a free-variable forall-left /
implication-left step that the finitary internal-Z calculus does not have.

The growth route instead proves non-provability from rates of growth:

  PA proves Goodstein
    -> the Goodstein length function is PA-provably total
    -> Wainer: every PA-provably-total recursive function is eventually bounded by
       some fast-growing `f_o`, `o < epsilon_0`
    -> Cichon/Caicedo: Goodstein length is not eventually bounded by any fixed
       `f_o`, `o < epsilon_0`
    -> contradiction.

The existing repo already proves the main concrete growth asset:
`GoodsteinPA.Dom.goodsteinLength_dominates_fastGrowing`.  This module now upgrades
that asset to the exact no-fixed-bound theorem needed by the route.  The remaining
named axiom is the Wainer PA-provably-total classification bridge.

/-- Cichon/Caicedo in the exact no-fixed-bound form needed by Wainer.

The repo's existing lower bound gives `f_{osucc o}(m) <= goodsteinLength m + 2`
eventually.  The successor-gap lemma above gives `f_o(m) + 2 < f_{osucc o}(m)` for
`m >= 4`.  Together they imply `f_o(m) < goodsteinLength m` eventually, so no fixed
`f_o` can eventually bound the Goodstein length function from above. -/
