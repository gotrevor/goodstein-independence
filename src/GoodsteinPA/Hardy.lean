# Growth theory of the fast-growing hierarchy

`Mathlib.SetTheory.Ordinal.Notation` already provides the **fast-growing hierarchy**
on ordinal notations below `ε₀`:

* `ONote.fastGrowing : ONote → ℕ → ℕ`  with `f₀ = succ`, `f_{α+1} = fun n => f_α^[n] n`,
  `f_λ = fun n => f_{λ[n]} n` (limit `λ`, via `ONote.fundamentalSequence`);
* `ONote.fastGrowingε₀ : ℕ → ℕ`, the one-step extension to `ε₀` itself.

mathlib proves the *small values* (`fastGrowing_one = (2 * ·)`, `fastGrowing_two = fun n => 2^n * n`,
`fastGrowingε₀_zero = 1`, `fastGrowingε₀_one = 2`) but **none of the growth theory**:
no expansiveness, no monotonicity, no domination. Those are exactly the facts the
Kirby–Paris growth argument needs, and they are the targets here.

These lemmas are mathlib-PR-shaped (they belong next to `ONote.fastGrowing`); developing
them here both serves the Goodstein-independence growth content and is independently useful.

## Normal-form hypotheses
`fastGrowing` is total on all of `ONote`, but the intended (and provable) statements
hold for **normal-form** notations (`ONote.NF`). Carry `[o.NF]`/`(h : o.NF)` where the
proof needs it; the `fundamentalSequence` correctness lemmas
(`ONote.fundamentalSequence_has_prop`, `ONote.FundamentalSequenceProp`) and the
`fastGrowing_zero'/_succ/_limit` characterizations are the entry points.
-/



/-- **Expansiveness.** Every level of the fast-growing hierarchy dominates the
identity: `n ≤ f_o(n)` for every notation `o` (no normal-form hypothesis needed —
`fundamentalSequence_has_prop` holds for all `o`).

Proof by well-founded recursion on `o` (the same `<`-recursion that *defines*
`fastGrowing`), via the three characterizations `fastGrowing_zero'/_succ/_limit`:
* `o = 0`: `f_o = Nat.succ`, so `n ≤ n+1`.
* successor `o = a+1`: `f_o n = (f_a)^[n] n`; by IH `id ≤ f_a`, and iterating a
  function that dominates the identity stays `≥ id` (`id_le_iterate_of_id_le`).
* limit: `f_o n = f_{o[n]} n` with `o[n] < o`, so the IH applies directly. -/

/-! ### Structural Bachmann reachability — the A3 crux, fully proved

The remaining difficulty in index monotonicity is now a pure statement about
`fundamentalSequence`: the descent of `o[n+1]` (budget `n+1`) passes exactly through
`o[n]`. We prove it by structural recursion on `o`, assembling four reusable facts:
`reaches_zero` (every notation descends to 0), `Reaches.oadd_tail` (descend a fixed
prefix's tail), `reaches_coeff_step'`/`reaches_coeff_chain` (drop a leading coefficient),
and `reaches_omega_pow_lift` (lift an exponent reach through `ω^·`). -/

/-- **Descend a fixed prefix's tail.** A structural reach on the tail lifts to the whole

it lifts via `fundamentalSequence_oadd_succ`/`fundamentalSequence_oadd_limit`. -/

/-- **The Bachmann reachability crux (A3, structural form).**  *(disclosed `sorry` — the
genuine hard core, now stated entirely structurally, free of `fastGrowing`.)*

For a limit notation `o` with fundamental sequence `f`, the *next* index `f (n+1)`
structurally reaches the *current* index `f n` with budget `n+1`:
`Reaches (n+1) (f (n+1)) (f n)`.

This is the **Bachmann property** of the standard CNF fundamental sequences: the descent
of `f (n+1)` (at the fixed index `n+1`) passes *exactly* through `f n` — because the
`ONote` fundamental sequence descends tails first and the coefficients pass through every
integer value, so no tail "overshoots". Once this is proved, *all* index monotonicity of
the fast-growing hierarchy follows from `fastGrowing_le_of_reaches` (already proved).

This is strictly sharper than the old analytic `sorry`: it isolates the difficulty into a
pure statement about `fundamentalSequence`, attackable by structural induction on `o` and
verifiable by `native_decide` on concrete notations. The successor-chain and `ω^2` cases
are already discharged (`fastGrowing_fundSeq_step_of_succ`, `fastGrowing_omega_sq_…`). -/

the index step is just `fastGrowing_le_succ_index`. This covers every limit of the form
`β + ω` (e.g. `ω, ω·k, ω+k`), whose fundamental sequence increments a finite tail.

Consequently the remaining genuine difficulty in `fastGrowing_fundSeq_step` lives
*only* at limits-of-limits (`ω^ω`, `ω^(ω+1)`, …), where `f n` is itself a limit and the
chain is not successor-stepwise — that is the sharp residue of the A3 crux. -/

/-- **Monotonicity propagates across a successor step.** If `o` is the notation-successor
of `a` (`fundamentalSequence o = inl (some a)`) and `f_a` is monotone, then so is `f_o`:
`f_o n = (f_a)^[n] n`, and iterating a monotone, `≥ id` map preserves monotonicity in the
diagonal `n ↦ (f_a)^[n] n`. (The successor companion of `fastGrowing_le_succ_index`, at the
level of the whole `Monotone` predicate.) -/

/-- **Monotonicity for successor-chain limits — the general engine, axiom-clean.**
If `o` is a limit whose fundamental sequence `f` is a *successor chain*
(`fundamentalSequence (f (k+1)) = inl (some (f k))`), then `f_o` is monotone *provided
only the bottom level `f 0` is monotone*: monotonicity of every `f k` then follows from
`fastGrowing_monotone_succ` along the chain, and the limit step is discharged by
`fastGrowing_fundSeq_step_of_succ`.

This is the clean companion to `fastGrowing_fundSeq_step_of_succ`: it lifts the *index
step* to the whole `Monotone` predicate, and covers every `β + ω`-type limit (`ω`, `ω·k`,
`β+ω`) in one stroke. The genuinely hard residue (`ω^ω`, `ω^(ω+1)`, …) — where the
fundamental sequence is not a successor chain — remains in `fastGrowing_fundSeq_step`. -/

# A4 — `fastGrowingε₀` dominates every fixed level (the headline domination crux)

The unboundedness that *is* the Goodstein/Kirby–Paris independence content:

> For every notation `o < ε₀`, eventually `fastGrowing o n < fastGrowingε₀ n`.

`fastGrowingε₀` is `mathlib`'s one-step extension of the fast-growing hierarchy to `ε₀`,
built on the *diagonal tower* fundamental sequence `0, 1, ω, ω^ω, ω^ω^ω, …` converging to
`ε₀`:

* `fastGrowingε₀ i = fastGrowing (tower i) i`, where `tower i = (fun a => ω^a)^[i] 0`.

This file pins the tower structure and **proves A4 in full, axiom-clean**. With
A1 (`le_fastGrowing`), A2 (`fastGrowing_monotone`) and A3 (`fastGrowing_bachmann_reach`)
proved in `Basic.lean`, the remaining content of A4 was an **index domination** fact: each
fixed `o` is eventually outgrown because the tower indices climb past it.

## Architecture (all proved, no `sorry`)
1. **Tower structure**: `tower (i+1) = ω^{tower i}`, `fastGrowingε₀` unfolds to
   `fastGrowing (tower i) i`; cofinality `tower_cofinal`.
2. **The CNF norm** `norm` + the **key cofinality bound**
   `lt_fundamentalSequence_of_norm_le` (THE new theorem): for a limit `β` and `α < β` with
   `norm α ≤ x`, already `α < g_β(x)`. Proved by structural induction over all six
   `fundamentalSequence` branches.
3. **General reachability** `reaches_of_lt`: `α < β ∧ norm α ≤ x ⟹ Reaches x β α`, by WF
   recursion on `β` reusing (2) at limits.
4. **Strictness** via the notation successor `osucc`: reach `osucc o` and take one strict
   successor index step (`fastGrowing_lt_succ_index`, needs `2 ≤ n`).

Headline: `fastGrowing_lt_fastGrowingε₀` — every fixed `f_o` is eventually strictly
dominated by `f_{ε₀}`. This is the unboundedness that *is* the Kirby–Paris growth gap.

/-! ### The CNF norm and structural comparison helpers (toward general Bachmann reachability)

The general index-domination needs a **budget condition**: the diagonal argument `x` must be
large enough that the fundamental-sequence descent of `β` actually passes through `α`. The
right "size of `α`" is its **CNF norm**: the largest finite number (coefficient or finite
tail) appearing anywhere in `α`'s Cantor normal form. -/

/-- **CNF norm** of a notation: the maximum finite coefficient appearing anywhere in its
Cantor normal form (recursively through exponents and tails). `norm 0 = 0`,
`norm (ω^e·n + a) = max (norm e) (max n (norm a))`. This is the budget threshold: if
`norm α ≤ x` then the standard fundamental-sequence descent of any `β > α` reaches `α` with
budget `x` (`reaches_of_lt`). -/

CNF term (`lt_oadd_cases`), to either the inductive hypothesis on the exponent/tail or the
single-level norm bound `lt_oadd_of_lead_le`. This is the one genuinely new theorem of the

# The Hardy hierarchy `H_α`

The **Hardy hierarchy** is the companion of the fast-growing hierarchy used in the
Kirby–Paris / Goodstein growth argument. mathlib has `ONote.fastGrowing` but **not**
the Hardy hierarchy at all — this file introduces it, mirroring `fastGrowing`'s
structure on `ONote.fundamentalSequence`:

* `H₀(n) = n`              (identity, vs. `f₀ = succ`)
* `H_{α+1}(n) = H_α(n+1)`  (one step of `+1`, vs. `f_{α+1} n = f_α^[n] n`)
* `H_λ(n) = H_{λ[n]}(n)`   (limit, via the fundamental sequence — same as `fastGrowing`)

It is **computable** (it builds on the computable `fundamentalSequence`), so we can
pin small values with `native_decide` anchors. The classical identity `H_{ω^α} = f_α`
(a long-horizon target, B4) connects it back to `fastGrowing`.

The definition uses the *same* well-founded `<`-recursion on `ONote` that defines
`fastGrowing`; the characterization lemmas `hardy_zero'/_succ/_limit` mirror
`fastGrowing_zero'/_succ/_limit` and are proved the same way (`hardy_def` + `subst`).

`H_{α+c}(n) = H_α(n+c)` for finite `c` — the Hardy hierarchy's additivity restricted to a finite
ordinal added on the right. The §19.6-cut-elimination "option 2" ingredient: it lets a *linearly*
reindexed ω-rule premise (index `n ↦ n+c`) be absorbed by a constant bump of the ordinal, so the
witness bound `H_α(n+c) < G(n)` reduces (for the `c`-bumped ordinal) to the banked domination
`H_{α+c}(n) < G(n)`. Proof: induction on `c` via the successor rule and `α + (c+1) = osucc (α + c)`. -/

/-! ### The Hardy step `hstep` and the step invariant `H_o(n) = H_{hstep o n}(n+1)`

The Hardy hierarchy "counts the steps" of an ordinal descent in which the *argument* grows
by one each time the ordinal drops past a successor. To make that precise we isolate one
**budget-incrementing step** `hstep o n`: descend through limit stages of `o` (each at the
fixed argument `n`) until passing exactly one successor, returning the resulting notation.
The single intrinsic fact we need is then `H_o(n) = H_{hstep o n}(n+1)` (`hardy_hstep`) for
nonzero `o` — the engine that telescopes any unit-step ordinal descent into a Hardy value.
This is the FastGrowing-side prerequisite for C3 (`Goodstein/Growth.lean`), where the
Goodstein descent is shown to *be* this Hardy step (`hstep_seqONote`). -/

/-- The fundamental sequence of a limit notation is everywhere nonzero: every branch of

/-- **Hardy tail-peeling — the additive law, ONote-native form.** Splitting off the tail of an `oadd`
composes the Hardy functions: `hardy (oadd a m b) n = hardy (oadd a m 0) (hardy b n)` (i.e.
`H_{ω^{repr a}·m + repr b}(n) = H_{ω^{repr a}·m}(H_{repr b}(n))`, valid since the tail `b` cannot absorb
the leading term). By well-founded recursion on the tail `b` — the same recursion `hardy`/
`fundamentalSequence` use (the fund. seq. of `oadd a m b` acts on the tail `b`): the successor and
limit tail cases each reduce to the IH at the smaller tail; the `b = 0` case is `hardy 0 = id`. No
ordinal-addition machinery needed — purely structural.

This is the **non-absorbing Hardy additive law** (the general `H_{α+β}=H_α∘H_β` is false —
`1+ω=ω` makes `H_{1+ω}=H_ω ≠ H_1∘H_ω`). It is the key brick for the coefficient lemma

/-! ### The general non-absorbing Hardy additive composition law `H_{γ+δ} = H_γ ∘ H_δ`

`hardy_oadd_tail` handles a single leading term. Generalizing the left summand `γ` to a full
Cantor-normal-form notation gives the additive composition law for *non-absorbing* sums: when
`δ` lies strictly below `γ`'s least exponent (so `γ + δ` is genuine CNF concatenation, no
coefficient merge), `H_{γ+δ}(x) = H_γ(H_δ(x))`. This is the load-bearing infra (B) for the
§19.6 control-ordinal operator calculus — the cut-elim control collapse
`H_{e+α}(x) = H_e(H_α(x))` is the instance with the cut-formula bound `α` below the control
ordinal `e`'s least term. The general `H_{α+β}=H_α∘H_β` is FALSE under absorption
(`1+ω=ω` ⟹ `H_{1+ω}=H_ω ≠ H_1∘H_ω`); the non-absorbing hypothesis is exactly what excludes it. -/
